00:35.960 --> 00:39.960
Hello, everybody, and welcome to the Modern Web Podcast.

00:39.960 --> 00:42.720
My name is Rob O'Sell, and I'm an architect at this.labs.

00:42.720 --> 00:48.240
Today, we are excited to be talking to Trisha Cat, who is a self-taught developer and dev

00:48.240 --> 00:50.320
rel engineer from South Africa.

00:50.320 --> 00:55.240
Trisha is going to be talking to us about getting started in development and in developer relations

00:55.240 --> 00:56.240
and developer advocacy.

00:56.240 --> 00:59.880
We're going to be talking about CSS, and who knows, a whole bunch of other topics.

00:59.880 --> 01:02.080
So Trisha, how are you doing today?

01:02.080 --> 01:03.720
Hi, Rob.

01:03.720 --> 01:05.560
Hello, everyone who's listening.

01:05.560 --> 01:11.680
I am doing amazing, I'm doing well, enjoying the weather as always, and yeah, man, I hope

01:11.680 --> 01:14.840
everyone will enjoy listening to this episode.

01:14.840 --> 01:19.480
Now talk to people, because when we release this, it's still going to be sort of the

01:19.480 --> 01:25.760
dead of winter in the United States, and a lot of people might be listening from, and

01:25.760 --> 01:30.240
we just had Groundhog's Day as the time of recording this, who condemned us to six more

01:30.240 --> 01:31.240
weeks of winter.

01:31.240 --> 01:35.960
So can you tell everybody, they're imagining you're enjoying the weather, they're thinking

01:35.960 --> 01:41.200
it's tropical and sunny, wherever you are, can you tell them what's actually happening?

01:41.200 --> 01:45.920
What's actually happening is I have the lights on inside the house, because it's so

01:45.920 --> 01:46.920
dark.

01:46.920 --> 01:52.880
It's like, it's like, the clouds are dark, actually, and it's, it's looking like it's

01:52.880 --> 01:55.240
going to be a violent rain.

01:55.240 --> 02:00.120
So I'm looking forward to all the thunderstorms, the lightning, hopefully it strikes somewhere

02:00.120 --> 02:05.320
okay, I'm joking, but yeah, man, I'm, I'm that kind of a person, I love rainy weather.

02:05.320 --> 02:10.680
I think it's amazing, it brings water to relaxing, and so I'm looking forward to that.

02:10.680 --> 02:11.680
Absolutely.

02:11.680 --> 02:15.280
I'm, I'm, I was mentioning this just before we started that I'm the same way, I'm from

02:15.280 --> 02:21.120
the Midwest, the United States, and I feel like that is our, our calming, healing energy

02:21.120 --> 02:26.360
is just opening all the windows and listening to the rumble of thunder from off in the distance

02:26.360 --> 02:31.800
as it slowly comes up and catches up to you, and you can kind of hear the water as it hits

02:31.800 --> 02:35.200
like a lake or something, and you can hear it moving across the lake until it gets to

02:35.200 --> 02:36.200
your house.

02:36.200 --> 02:40.480
I mean, that is, that is just childhood in a, in a single image to me.

02:40.480 --> 02:47.080
So hopefully you get a, a, an enjoyable storm where you are.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.080
Thanks.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.080
I hope I do too.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.080
All right.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.480
Well, let's jump right into it.

02:51.480 --> 02:55.000
And you know, to get us started, I think people are going to be interested to hear about your

02:55.000 --> 02:56.840
journey, at least just the beginnings of it.

02:56.840 --> 03:02.560
So could you give us like a condensed version of kind of how you came to be in development,

03:02.560 --> 03:05.760
because I think people would be interested to hear how that came to be.

03:06.240 --> 03:07.400
Yes, of course.

03:07.400 --> 03:14.440
So Rob mentioned that I am self-taught and I am based in South Africa, which is like

03:14.440 --> 03:20.920
the hardest place to actually land your first job as a self-taught without any degree diploma.

03:20.920 --> 03:28.560
And so my journey started when I dropped out of college in 2021.

03:28.560 --> 03:32.720
And I decided to self-teach myself with pre-code camp.

03:32.760 --> 03:38.000
And after that, a few months later, I think three months into my starting journey, I'm

03:38.000 --> 03:39.080
not sure.

03:39.080 --> 03:47.640
I landed my first U.S. freelance gig, which I worked on for six months until January 2022,

03:47.640 --> 03:49.320
which was last year.

03:49.320 --> 03:55.840
And then after that, I sort of discovered Debrell and what it was and I wanted to join

03:55.840 --> 03:58.560
and be a developer advocate.

03:58.560 --> 04:06.240
And months, I think two months, I joined Strapi as a developer advocate intern.

04:06.240 --> 04:09.800
And so that's basically how my journey has started.

04:09.800 --> 04:14.880
It all started with dropping out of college, starting a course in pre-code camp and being

04:14.880 --> 04:21.760
exposed to my first remote freelance gig and then lending my internship at Strapi.

04:21.760 --> 04:27.440
You know, it's such an interesting decision that I know was difficult at times for you,

04:27.440 --> 04:33.840
because everybody is sort of told, going to college, that's the pathway to your life

04:33.840 --> 04:34.840
working out.

04:34.840 --> 04:39.320
And maybe you're being told that from being a young child and then to decide to drop out

04:39.320 --> 04:45.560
to pursue this vision, it's not only difficult, it's a lot of work, but it's got to be difficult

04:45.560 --> 04:51.080
because you were on supposedly a track that was going to inevitably lead to success.

04:51.080 --> 04:58.120
So how did you stay focused, motivated, and not want to give up and go back to the path

04:58.120 --> 04:59.120
that you were on before?

04:59.120 --> 05:06.800
Like how did you stay committed to that when sort of that doubt might be crept in?

05:06.800 --> 05:13.000
That's a good question and I must be honest with you, I felt like giving up most of the

05:13.000 --> 05:20.240
time because I've never actually found anyone who was in the exact same position.

05:20.240 --> 05:25.880
And as I was at that time, who was South African, who was Black South African, who was

05:25.880 --> 05:31.680
working for companies outside of South Africa as a self-taught developer.

05:31.680 --> 05:39.520
And so having no one to look out for was difficult on its own because I had no role model.

05:39.520 --> 05:45.880
I had no certainty that whatever I'm doing, is it worth it, must I go back to college?

05:45.880 --> 05:51.720
And I would say what gave me motivation was tech Twitter.

05:51.720 --> 05:56.880
When I saw that other people, even though they were in other provinces, not provinces,

05:56.880 --> 06:02.360
other countries, they also felt the same way in my shoes.

06:02.360 --> 06:10.000
And when I saw people posting their good news that they finally landed a role as a self-taught

06:10.000 --> 06:15.480
developer in some remote company, that just helped me to not give up.

06:15.480 --> 06:23.480
It helped me to move forward and it's like, I was like, okay, if it does happen for me,

06:23.480 --> 06:29.840
then I can also be a role model for someone who is in the same shoes as I am.

06:29.840 --> 06:35.200
And so I went on ahead, I joined communities, I found like-minded people and those people

06:35.200 --> 06:40.560
helped me to be motivated and they really helped me too much.

06:40.560 --> 06:47.240
And I wouldn't have found that you as a remote freelance role, if it wasn't for the connection

06:47.240 --> 06:52.400
I made with someone else, because that someone referred me to that person and that's how

06:52.400 --> 06:53.360
I got the role.

06:53.360 --> 06:58.200
And so it's all about making great connections.

06:58.200 --> 07:04.520
And once you have those great connections, then you have a great motivation to go on.

07:05.520 --> 07:11.960
You know, it's such a great point because when you come up, especially you're starting out

07:11.960 --> 07:15.960
in a self-taught environment, so not necessarily in a program, you're doing it in the pandemic

07:15.960 --> 07:21.960
when we're all already more isolated than we had been in the past, community and finding

07:21.960 --> 07:22.960
it.

07:22.960 --> 07:27.200
I mean, what an amazing opportunity that you found on Twitter.

07:27.200 --> 07:31.880
But I think I remember reading that your decision to join Twitter was also sort of serendipitous

07:31.880 --> 07:34.080
in some ways.

07:34.080 --> 07:38.760
It wasn't necessarily something that had a ton of forethought or was quite inevitable

07:38.760 --> 07:39.760
itself.

07:39.760 --> 07:44.360
So how did you decide to stumble into tech Twitter, right?

07:44.360 --> 07:46.480
Because there's a million communities on Twitter.

07:46.480 --> 07:52.000
So what made you sort of look there and get on Twitter in the first place?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Okay.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
So, Twitter.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Okay.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.240
So I joined Twitter, I think 2020, that was like my first day in college.

08:01.240 --> 08:07.040
So throughout my life in high school, you can see that I had no social media whatsoever.

08:07.040 --> 08:13.560
That's how, I don't know, I was like, anti-social media, I'm not the kind of person who like

08:13.560 --> 08:16.600
social media, I just thought it was a waste of time.

08:16.600 --> 08:24.040
Maybe it's my father's mentality talking here, but it's just, and I was like, okay, I need

08:24.040 --> 08:29.480
to like have some social presence because I heard that when people hire somebody, they

08:29.480 --> 08:35.440
look out for their social life so that they can see if they have a digital footprint.

08:35.440 --> 08:41.000
And if you don't have a digital footprint, then you are considered weird, like, why don't

08:41.000 --> 08:42.320
you have social media?

08:42.320 --> 08:46.080
And so I was like, okay, let me join Twitter.

08:46.080 --> 08:51.920
And I joined Twitter initially just to like follow some trends and I don't know, like

08:51.920 --> 08:53.520
do all nonsense.

08:53.520 --> 09:01.320
And then after, so okay, so my cousin, she was doing her online business at the time

09:01.320 --> 09:05.840
and she was like, she wants someone to make a website for her and she told me to make

09:05.840 --> 09:09.240
a website for her and then I did the whole Google process.

09:09.240 --> 09:14.960
It's in my blog, I wrote a blog about this, so I'm just like doing a summary.

09:14.960 --> 09:23.760
So after that, I found a media travesty, travesty media to do the HTML course.

09:23.760 --> 09:28.960
And then I went to Twitter, I created my account, went to Twitter and I followed Brad

09:28.960 --> 09:34.480
travesty and along with Brad travesty, you know how Twitter suggests some people to follow

09:34.480 --> 09:37.280
and that's how it came to be.

09:37.280 --> 09:44.040
And then somehow I got, I saw this hashtag 100 days of code and I clicked on that hashtag

09:44.040 --> 09:47.800
and I saw like what was happening, I see people are learning, people are sharing what

09:47.800 --> 09:49.520
they're learning.

09:49.520 --> 09:56.240
And I was like, okay, so this is how I'm going to dip my toes into tech Twitter.

09:56.240 --> 10:01.720
And that didn't happen that same year, I became active on Twitter in 2021 because I joined

10:01.720 --> 10:03.480
in 2020.

10:03.480 --> 10:10.280
And so yeah, that's how I did my toes into tech Twitter, 100 days of code became what

10:10.280 --> 10:11.280
is it?

10:11.280 --> 10:16.080
These code newbies, I follow people, people make connections, comments and everything

10:16.080 --> 10:22.200
and then my timeline was filled with web development stuff and that's how I came to be.

10:22.200 --> 10:25.720
And that's my Twitter, my Twitter stuff.

10:25.720 --> 10:30.800
It's so fascinating because yeah, when I got on, I mean, I was on Twitter very early on,

10:30.800 --> 10:33.840
but I didn't use it much at the beginning, it was just sort of a playful thing to keep

10:33.840 --> 10:34.840
up with news.

10:34.840 --> 10:40.520
But when I got on found the tech sphere, I don't know what it was about my mentality

10:40.520 --> 10:45.120
that I just assumed that like all the developers in the universe were at the company I worked

10:45.120 --> 10:46.840
at and the companies my friends worked at.

10:46.840 --> 10:50.320
Like, I don't know why for some reason it just never occurred to me that there must

10:50.320 --> 10:54.080
be hundreds of thousands, millions of us around.

10:54.080 --> 10:57.920
And so getting on to Twitter, it was like, oh, this is such a cool place to find good

10:57.920 --> 11:00.960
blogs to read and to share blogs.

11:00.960 --> 11:04.600
But then it's when you make those connections that you're talking about, like you get on

11:04.600 --> 11:11.560
that hashtag and you find somebody who posted their first sample project and they just

11:11.560 --> 11:13.400
ask for advice.

11:13.400 --> 11:16.960
And you know, I got the opportunity to reach out to somebody, they posted their project,

11:16.960 --> 11:19.800
I had a couple of minutes, so I looked at it, I said, oh, this is really great.

11:19.800 --> 11:23.840
Maybe here's some advice and things to look at and followed them.

11:23.840 --> 11:29.680
And then, you know, a few months later, they get a project and it's shared by Sarah Drasner

11:29.680 --> 11:33.400
and then they have a, you know, a course that they sell and they're making a bunch of money

11:33.400 --> 11:38.040
and then all of a sudden they get like an amazing job and you're like, that was so cool

11:38.040 --> 11:40.200
to watch somebody blow up like that.

11:40.200 --> 11:45.920
I don't know what it is, but it really is a great place despite all of the other things

11:45.920 --> 11:47.840
going on on the platform.

11:47.840 --> 11:53.280
It's not perfect from end to end, but it's those connections and those moments that I

11:53.280 --> 11:59.120
think still make it so worth it for people, even people starting now.

11:59.120 --> 12:02.440
I don't know if you, if you would agree, if you would suggest to somebody get involved

12:02.440 --> 12:07.080
in Twitter if they were just starting today, but I just feel like those connections you

12:07.080 --> 12:13.000
can make are so valuable to, you know, finding a job, sure, but even just finding a community

12:13.000 --> 12:18.040
or a network of people or role models to look up to that have, that are walking your, maybe

12:18.040 --> 12:19.680
your similar path.

12:19.680 --> 12:27.000
Yes, I definitely agree with you and as someone who has, I might not look it, but I have social

12:27.000 --> 12:33.120
anxiety people, believe me, I am not a social person.

12:33.120 --> 12:37.400
I'm afraid of approaching people, I don't want to disturb anyone's peace.

12:37.400 --> 12:44.600
And so when I, I was like starting out with creating connections on Twitter, it usually

12:44.600 --> 12:51.440
starts with the comment sections because I'm not someone who DMs people, I don't do that.

12:51.440 --> 12:55.920
It's like, it's too personal, I'm invading a space directly by doing that.

12:55.920 --> 13:01.440
So like the comment sections, 100 days of code, like I said, it's the perfect place

13:01.440 --> 13:06.000
to find people who are like learning the exact same thing as you.

13:06.000 --> 13:12.000
And so that's how like, I started my early connections, I saw someone was learning JavaScript

13:12.000 --> 13:15.880
and they were facing the exact same problem as I was.

13:15.880 --> 13:21.000
And I kept on asking questions in the comment section, each time they posted, I look forward

13:21.000 --> 13:26.640
to the post so that I can reply to them and have a conversation from there.

13:26.640 --> 13:33.080
And I think like a few months later, that exact same person, like I said, got me the

13:33.080 --> 13:38.440
opportunity to the remote US freelance opportunity.

13:38.440 --> 13:45.880
So it's like, it doesn't have to be you approaching big accounts to make great connections.

13:45.880 --> 13:51.000
It's someone small, someone at that small hashtag, someone with two, three likes can

13:51.000 --> 13:57.400
help you in so many ways than someone with, I don't know, like 90k followers.

13:57.400 --> 14:02.840
And so it's really important to not look at the numbers when you're creating connections.

14:02.840 --> 14:07.200
Just look at the person, look at what they are, what they're bringing out and reach out

14:07.200 --> 14:12.440
to them, compliment them, ask them questions, start small and it would lead to something

14:12.440 --> 14:13.440
big.

14:13.440 --> 14:20.160
And so it's a great place to make connections with people outside of your own country because

14:20.160 --> 14:22.640
like Twitter is worldwide.

14:22.640 --> 14:29.000
And so it gives you a sense of being open-minded, being introduced to people's different work

14:29.000 --> 14:30.560
cultures and everything.

14:30.560 --> 14:33.560
And so take advantage of it.

14:33.560 --> 14:37.000
That's all I can say.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.560
It's so great to meet another person that has the same opinion on DMs.

14:40.560 --> 14:43.320
I was having that conversation with someone recently.

14:43.320 --> 14:47.360
They were like, how many DMs conversations do you have active at any given point in time?

14:47.360 --> 14:49.040
And I was like, what are you talking about?

14:49.040 --> 14:50.640
Like one every couple months?

14:50.640 --> 14:53.600
And they're like, I have 10 every single day going on.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.800
And I'm like, how?

14:55.800 --> 14:56.960
How does that even happen?

14:56.960 --> 14:59.520
Like, how does that even initiate?

14:59.520 --> 15:02.320
So yeah, I'm really familiar with you.

15:02.320 --> 15:11.160
You know, I think it's funny to, I need to sort of break the illusion here of humility

15:11.160 --> 15:15.800
because we need to call attention to the fact that you are knocking on the door as the time

15:15.800 --> 15:20.520
of this recording of 40K followers on Twitter right now.

15:20.520 --> 15:25.880
So you know, all of the things that you're talking about that you've overcome notwithstanding,

15:25.880 --> 15:28.040
it's been very successful for you.

15:28.080 --> 15:33.680
And what I like about that is that, you know, you've done it, as you said, not as someone

15:33.680 --> 15:39.440
who is setting out to become famous or coming to build this with an objective and maybe

15:39.440 --> 15:42.400
not even to necessarily do it with a particular strategy.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.760
You've probably developed things, maybe that work well.

15:44.760 --> 15:50.120
But I like that you've built this a bit on the back of being authentic and humorous

15:50.120 --> 15:52.600
and a little bit self-deprecating, but also serious.

15:52.600 --> 16:00.000
So I don't know, can you explain to me, if you try to reflect on it, how that happened

16:00.000 --> 16:04.920
and how you approach Twitter and how you kind of, you know, want to engage with it just

16:04.920 --> 16:06.840
from your own content?

16:08.480 --> 16:12.080
Okay, so how do I overcome?

16:12.080 --> 16:13.800
I don't know.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.640
I can be a weird individual sometimes.

16:16.640 --> 16:21.000
What did you say, self-deprecating?

16:21.840 --> 16:25.000
Sometimes some of your tweets are humorous, but sometimes they're humorous because it's

16:25.000 --> 16:28.920
like, I'll never figure out JavaScript or like, you know, this kind of stuff.

16:28.920 --> 16:36.560
So it's very relatable, it's like the thoughts that flip through our mind sometimes in the

16:36.560 --> 16:43.160
midst of a hard problem, you find a way to put them as one line very succinctly on your

16:43.160 --> 16:44.160
Twitter.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.160
It's incredibly relatable.

16:45.240 --> 16:51.240
I assume that's why so many people have followed you is to the relatability of what you're

16:51.240 --> 16:52.240
putting down there.

16:52.240 --> 16:58.020
Yes, actually, I have been told, but in our honesty, people, if you follow at Trisha

16:58.020 --> 17:03.160
KS, please do let me know why you follow me because I don't know why I have no idea

17:03.160 --> 17:12.120
why people follow me, but okay, so I would say it's like, okay, I treat Twitter as my,

17:12.360 --> 17:17.880
should I say like my diary, like my confession, like my, like my everything, like where I

17:17.880 --> 17:22.920
trash talk or if I have some unfunny funny jokes, maybe funny jokes for me.

17:22.920 --> 17:26.040
And then I'm like, oh, actually, people are liking this.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.920
It's like, I just post them out.

17:27.920 --> 17:32.280
And also, my tweets are short because I don't like to read long things.

17:32.280 --> 17:39.040
I'm not someone who likes to read long stuff, even like threads, unless it's like, it's

17:39.120 --> 17:41.280
really something I have to learn.

17:41.280 --> 17:42.280
I want to understand.

17:42.280 --> 17:46.680
But otherwise, I'm not someone who likes to read a long sentence.

17:46.680 --> 17:51.280
Like one sentence that is effective straight to the point touches your soul, you're related

17:51.280 --> 17:55.400
to it, then that's, that's like, that's like good enough for me.

17:55.400 --> 18:01.240
And so I always try to keep my tweets short because that's the kind of tweets I would

18:01.240 --> 18:02.240
like to see.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.000
I'm not judging anyone on anything.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.160
You are your own person.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.160
I'm my own person.

18:07.160 --> 18:08.160
I like short things.

18:08.160 --> 18:11.680
You might like long things, but then I do what works for me.

18:11.680 --> 18:14.920
And if you like it, then thank you so much.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.160
I, I don't try to be relatable.

18:17.160 --> 18:22.520
I just, I post things that just randomly go through my mind or the thing I faced for the

18:22.520 --> 18:23.880
day.

18:23.880 --> 18:30.320
And so yeah, I, yeah, I guess that's like, that's it on that.

18:30.320 --> 18:34.880
Well, you know, it's interesting because there is something to be said about finding your

18:34.880 --> 18:37.440
style or knowing your style and being authentic.

18:37.440 --> 18:41.060
It's a much easier to be yourself than to, you know, if you were going to approach Twitter

18:41.060 --> 18:44.160
and say, well, it seems like all of tech Twitter is long post and thread.

18:44.160 --> 18:48.440
So I need to find a way to do what I would normally do as long posts and threads.

18:48.440 --> 18:49.760
It wouldn't sound like you.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.720
It maybe wouldn't be interesting to follow.

18:51.720 --> 18:58.760
So you know, as you sort of develop that style, like, have you adopted any of what we'll call

18:58.760 --> 18:59.760
the Twitter meta?

18:59.760 --> 19:04.680
Like, have you, have you become more aware of the, the times when posting gets more engagement

19:04.680 --> 19:07.240
or, or is this truly sort of incidental?

19:07.240 --> 19:12.120
Like, you're just posting what you're thinking when you're thinking of it and it's still

19:12.120 --> 19:13.120
connecting.

19:13.120 --> 19:19.280
Well, I would say I'm just, I'm just the person you see people as the person you see

19:19.280 --> 19:26.400
on my timeline, I, I, I post what I like, I post what I think, but I will admit starting

19:26.400 --> 19:32.760
my early days of content creation on tech, Twitter, it's, it's, it's really hard to like

19:32.800 --> 19:38.280
immediately find a niche, something you, you would like to be known for.

19:38.280 --> 19:42.960
And so I have dipped and doubled on some few things that creating threads.

19:42.960 --> 19:46.720
Like I just said, I don't like threads and I created threads.

19:46.720 --> 19:53.040
And I guess I wouldn't say I expressed myself authentically doing that.

19:53.040 --> 19:57.880
And then also, if you are on Twitter, Rob, you, you always, you must have seen people

19:57.880 --> 20:04.080
posting eight AI tools and, you know, yeah, you know,

20:04.080 --> 20:05.000
right, exactly.

20:05.000 --> 20:13.880
Yeah, the eight AI tools, he has how to find them a thread and all that stuff.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.400
I've tried all of those.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.160
They didn't work for me.

20:17.160 --> 20:20.440
And then I was like, okay, everyone is doing it.

20:20.440 --> 20:22.240
Every account is doing it.

20:22.240 --> 20:27.240
Everyone is like, I don't know how do I set you apart from someone else?

20:27.240 --> 20:31.640
Because it's like, I will follow five people and then post the same thing,

20:31.640 --> 20:33.800
the same syntax, whatever.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.640
I'm saying syntax on Twitter people.

20:35.640 --> 20:42.520
I don't know why, but it's like, I had to think of like setting myself apart.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.720
You know, like, what, what is it I would like to be known for?

20:45.720 --> 20:48.360
I don't want to be like everyone else, you know?

20:48.360 --> 20:51.920
And so it's like, okay, what do I like to do?

20:51.920 --> 20:53.520
I like to do CSS.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.120
I like to do CSS code.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.600
I like to do CSS arts.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.320
And then I started by that.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.120
I started sharing my CSS arts.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.960
I started to share my CSS project.

21:02.960 --> 21:05.480
And then from project, it went to CSS puns.

21:05.480 --> 21:09.320
And I was like, hmm, I'm a sucker for dead jokes.

21:09.320 --> 21:11.680
Let me post those and people like them.

21:11.680 --> 21:16.880
And then I was like, hmm, the more I learned JavaScript, I could be able to make a pun

21:16.880 --> 21:19.840
out of JavaScript and make some unfunny jokes.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.760
And then I posted those two.

21:21.760 --> 21:24.600
And so over time, people liked it.

21:24.600 --> 21:29.320
And then I have what, close to 40K followers on Twitter.

21:29.320 --> 21:33.800
I don't know why people, but yes, it's, it's like that.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.320
It took some time.

21:35.320 --> 21:41.560
So just, just be yourself, be authentic self, set yourself apart, make people think

21:41.560 --> 21:42.720
about you.

21:42.720 --> 21:46.480
And when they think about you, they must associate something with you.

21:46.480 --> 21:51.120
Like when they think of CSS, they're like, okay, I'm going to follow Tricia.

21:51.480 --> 21:54.840
Sorry, I'm going to follow Tricia or web three.

21:54.840 --> 21:58.160
I'm going to follow Francesco or Denny Thompson.

21:58.160 --> 22:02.080
I'm going to follow for motivation, inspiration, that sort of thing.

22:02.440 --> 22:07.560
And so your goal is to be identified by something and have that something

22:07.560 --> 22:10.120
associated with your name on tech Twitter.

22:10.600 --> 22:11.720
That's my advice.

22:11.720 --> 22:14.480
I can give you on growing on tech to be yourself.

22:14.480 --> 22:18.280
Share your niche and just, just do what you like.

22:18.280 --> 22:20.120
And then people will like you for it.

22:20.280 --> 22:22.040
You don't have to do a lot of things.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.400
It just, it will grow on its own.

22:25.600 --> 22:26.240
Be patient.

22:27.720 --> 22:28.720
Patience is a big one.

22:29.240 --> 22:33.560
But, you know, I like this idea too that, you know, when everybody is, if

22:33.560 --> 22:38.920
everybody's doing a certain thing, then people feel compelled to do it and they

22:38.920 --> 22:41.680
feel a little bit like you did at the beginning, which is to say, like people

22:41.680 --> 22:45.160
without a community, they say, well, I like weird silly jokes.

22:45.160 --> 22:46.760
And I like not taking things too seriously.

22:46.760 --> 22:49.200
And I like talking about CSS, but everybody's talking about React.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.120
So I guess I need to talk about React on Twitter.

22:51.480 --> 22:55.600
And it's like, you know, I was a, a gamer many years ago, long before it was

22:55.600 --> 22:56.880
quite as mainstream as it was now.

22:56.880 --> 22:59.640
And I remember being in conversations with people and, you know, you're like, oh,

22:59.640 --> 23:01.880
the weather, oh, sports, oh, business.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.440
And you kind of just have in that conversation.

23:03.680 --> 23:06.160
And then maybe it slips that one of you plays a video game.

23:06.160 --> 23:09.000
And then the other person goes, wait, you play, you play video games.

23:10.280 --> 23:15.160
And all of a sudden then this, all this animation and, you know, this, this nerd

23:15.160 --> 23:18.760
found another nerd and they have a moment of community and bonding.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.160
And a deeper conversation than they ever would have had.

23:21.560 --> 23:23.040
And you can be that on Twitter, right?

23:23.040 --> 23:26.280
Like you can be that person that is talking about the thing that maybe

23:26.280 --> 23:29.320
nobody else is talking about, but people really want to, but think they're not

23:29.320 --> 23:29.920
allowed to.

23:30.240 --> 23:33.480
Uh, and you know, it's like you said, when clearly people were hungry for that

23:33.480 --> 23:38.960
kind of, uh, you know, silliness as well as CSS talk, uh, in a world full of a

23:38.960 --> 23:40.000
lot of JavaScript talks.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.520
So, um, you know, happy that you found a niche.

23:42.680 --> 23:45.920
Maybe not everybody will find quite as potent of a niche, but you'll certainly

23:45.920 --> 23:47.720
enjoy your experience on Twitter a lot more.

23:47.720 --> 23:52.200
You will find your tribe, even if your tribe isn't extremely large, uh, as long

23:52.200 --> 23:53.080
as you're being yourself.

23:53.120 --> 23:54.800
So yeah, absolutely.

23:56.760 --> 23:57.080
Okay.

23:57.080 --> 24:01.960
So then you sort of progress from, from, uh, well, I mean, you're still on Twitter,

24:01.960 --> 24:05.200
but we've progressed the story from, from Twitter to getting a job.

24:05.200 --> 24:09.480
And what's fascinating about your job journey is that you pretty quickly went,

24:09.560 --> 24:14.400
um, from self taught developer to developer relations engineer or developer

24:14.400 --> 24:19.760
advocate and, um, you know, this is certainly a career that has over gone a

24:19.760 --> 24:23.880
lot of changes, certainly during the pandemic, but, but over the last many

24:23.880 --> 24:28.880
years as the, as it's matured, um, and, you know, I don't know that there's been a

24:28.880 --> 24:32.760
ton of people talking about starting with developer relations or developer

24:32.760 --> 24:37.520
advocacy as opposed to like maybe, um, switching over to it after a little bit

24:37.520 --> 24:38.480
of time of being a developer.

24:38.480 --> 24:42.480
So can you kind of explain, um, how you, I mean, you talked a little bit about how

24:42.480 --> 24:46.920
you got the job, but kind of how you got into this, uh, this career and how you

24:46.920 --> 24:51.880
sort of, uh, dealt with it coming from maybe not, you know, a 10 year career

24:51.880 --> 24:55.120
being a developer already and kind of what challenges and opportunities that,

24:55.160 --> 24:56.000
that provided for you.

24:58.200 --> 24:58.720
Okay.

24:58.720 --> 25:07.760
So how I, I would say how I discovered developer advocacy was because of

25:07.840 --> 25:11.520
Pratham does, there's a user by the name of Pratham.

25:11.520 --> 25:18.560
She's an Indian, uh, developer advocate at N host, which is an open source company.

25:18.560 --> 25:25.560
I forgot for what, but she is the sole responsible person that I am in developer

25:25.560 --> 25:26.160
advocacy.

25:26.160 --> 25:28.440
Well, I was interested in it.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.000
I am still in interested in it.

25:30.440 --> 25:37.000
Um, and so I discovered that last year, like January, February,

25:37.000 --> 25:46.400
summer day, and I, what, what really brought me into liking Devra was how it was

25:46.400 --> 25:48.920
described the role of the job.

25:49.440 --> 25:53.760
So the role of the job, basically, it involves, I think, four pillars.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.680
If I'm not mistaken, one is education.

25:56.680 --> 26:02.600
So creating content for developers, making sure that they are learning, uh, about the

26:02.600 --> 26:04.720
product they, they are representing.

26:04.720 --> 26:09.440
And so, uh, the education you create is to help developers be successful with the

26:09.440 --> 26:10.520
product they're using.

26:10.760 --> 26:16.120
And then the second pillar is marketing, bringing awareness, going to tech conferences,

26:16.120 --> 26:18.440
speaking about the product you're representing.

26:18.440 --> 26:27.160
The third thing is, um, if I'm not mistaken, it's community, community management.

26:27.520 --> 26:32.360
So you're going to be engaging a lot with community management, uh, community

26:32.360 --> 26:35.600
members and helping them out.

26:35.600 --> 26:40.360
And, you know, just basically forming relationships with your community.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.720
And then the fourth one is coding.

26:43.040 --> 26:48.600
So you must have some technical skill to be able to relate with the community you

26:48.600 --> 26:52.040
are representing for to the company.

26:52.560 --> 26:55.720
And so I was like, that's a nice job.

26:55.720 --> 27:00.360
That is what I am doing as a, as a tech tweeter person.

27:00.520 --> 27:01.640
I'm not an influencer.

27:01.640 --> 27:03.840
I refuse to be known as that.

27:05.800 --> 27:12.760
That is what I'm doing here on Twitter.

27:13.760 --> 27:21.360
So I, what I, what led me into believing that I can also be a developer advocate was

27:21.360 --> 27:23.560
that I'm so, I have a blog.

27:24.200 --> 27:25.640
I love writing things down.

27:25.640 --> 27:30.520
I, I would say I communicate so much better when I write things down.

27:30.520 --> 27:33.120
It's an actual verbal communication.

27:33.120 --> 27:35.520
And so I love creating content.

27:35.920 --> 27:39.760
I love, uh, showing people how they can use something.

27:39.760 --> 27:43.520
I remember there was a time where Tylen CSS was something new to me.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.240
And I started using it.

27:45.240 --> 27:50.400
And then I went all in to convince people that, hey, leave bootstrap behind.

27:50.440 --> 27:52.080
Bootstrap is not for you.

27:52.080 --> 27:53.400
Go to Tylen CSS.

27:53.680 --> 27:55.720
I will convince you, I will show you.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.080
And that's what I did.

27:57.080 --> 28:01.680
I would make demos and show people that this is how you build a button in less

28:01.680 --> 28:05.280
than five minutes, of course, if my typing speed suffices.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.480
But, you know, I, I used to do those things.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.240
I used to like advocate.

28:10.240 --> 28:15.440
I used to, I, I, I like communicating with people, the community and all that stuff.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.920
I know I said I have social anxiety.

28:17.920 --> 28:23.480
I don't like to talk to people, but I do enjoy to talk to somebody to help them

28:23.480 --> 28:24.520
achieve something.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.640
And so I was enjoying that.

28:26.640 --> 28:27.920
And I was like coding.

28:27.920 --> 28:28.800
I, I code.

28:28.800 --> 28:29.760
I love to code.

28:29.760 --> 28:31.520
I would say it's fun.

28:31.520 --> 28:33.960
It's, it's, it's a combination of things that I like.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.760
And I want to experience this field.

28:35.760 --> 28:37.840
I want to work as a developer advocate.

28:38.440 --> 28:39.600
I got the job.

28:39.600 --> 28:40.840
I worked at Strapi.

28:40.840 --> 28:41.800
It was amazing.

28:41.800 --> 28:44.400
It was everything I imagined and even more.

28:44.920 --> 28:50.240
And, and so, yeah, man, I, I don't know if I should go on from this point.

28:50.240 --> 28:55.040
But the point is developer advocacy is an amazing role.

28:55.040 --> 29:00.080
It's, it's just like you work with people, you meet amazing people.

29:00.080 --> 29:05.720
And you, you get to do the things you like as a job and you get paid for it.

29:05.720 --> 29:10.040
I mean, who gets paid to write blogs for fun?

29:10.320 --> 29:12.400
I mean, I find it writing fun.

29:12.400 --> 29:16.040
And, and you know, it's, it's like, it's a dream position.

29:16.280 --> 29:21.560
And also you travel, but I didn't get the chance to, but still you travel because

29:21.560 --> 29:22.320
of your job.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.960
And so it has a lot of con.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.920
No, wait, is it cons or pros?

29:26.920 --> 29:27.720
Which one is good?

29:27.960 --> 29:29.040
Which one is the pros?

29:29.560 --> 29:30.360
OK, it's the pros.

29:31.320 --> 29:34.200
Oh, my God, the pros are good.

29:35.120 --> 29:35.920
That's what I mean.

29:35.920 --> 29:37.040
The pros are good.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.040
That's what I meant.

29:38.040 --> 29:44.040
So yeah, it's interesting because, you know, I think I think people have gotten

29:44.040 --> 29:47.200
better in the community of understanding this role a little bit more.

29:47.200 --> 29:52.280
But I think there are still some, maybe perceptions or misperceptions exist.

29:52.800 --> 29:58.520
Um, one of them is that, oh, I want to be in DevRel because I would just get

29:58.520 --> 30:03.120
to code demos all day and then travel to conferences and it would be the coolest

30:03.120 --> 30:03.560
job.

30:03.800 --> 30:07.280
I hear a lot of people talking about it the same way they talk about like being

30:07.480 --> 30:09.720
like a Twitch streamer or like a YouTuber.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.720
They're like, oh, I get to play video games all day for a living.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.120
What an amazing life.

30:14.480 --> 30:19.480
And I don't think they fully understand the hard bits behind it, the metrics, the

30:19.480 --> 30:21.960
parts that are not as glamorous, but are difficult.

30:22.280 --> 30:25.800
Um, and other people worry that, you know, if I go to DevRel, maybe all I'll be

30:25.800 --> 30:28.760
doing is blogs or all I'll be doing is talking to people.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.640
I lose all my technical acumen.

30:30.640 --> 30:31.920
I won't grow anymore.

30:32.160 --> 30:36.240
So I wonder if you could speak to both of those perceptions, both that DevRel is

30:36.240 --> 30:42.200
this glamorous, enjoyable, never ending fun of all the best parts of development

30:42.200 --> 30:45.600
and none of the hard parts like deadlines and clients.

30:46.080 --> 30:50.240
And the other side of people that feel like it's non-technical and maybe they

30:50.240 --> 30:54.600
would, they would not be as much of a developer or, or struggle in their growth

30:54.600 --> 30:55.360
if they were DevRel.

30:58.080 --> 30:58.600
Okay.

30:58.600 --> 31:05.480
So I would say developer relations is, like you said, there are good parts and

31:05.480 --> 31:07.080
then there are bad parts to it.

31:07.600 --> 31:13.400
But for me personally speaking, oh no, personally speaking for myself, I would

31:13.400 --> 31:18.480
say the bad part is there's a lot of things going on.

31:18.480 --> 31:23.640
Like as much as the schedule, like you don't know how your day is going to go,

31:23.880 --> 31:24.960
which is awesome.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.720
I, I like that about it.

31:27.240 --> 31:30.760
But at the same time, it's like, you don't know how your day is going to go.

31:31.080 --> 31:32.840
And you have so much to learn.

31:32.840 --> 31:34.680
There's a lot of things to learn.

31:35.200 --> 31:40.640
And I remember there was, I, we were working on an initiative at Strapi.

31:40.640 --> 31:45.160
And one of the initiatives was to form a partnership with Versell.

31:45.520 --> 31:48.800
And it's not exactly marketing.

31:48.800 --> 31:54.400
It's not exactly, you know, community and, and, um, you know, education.

31:54.400 --> 31:55.680
It's more like sales.

31:56.000 --> 32:01.360
So you have to like get into other departments and to work with other teams.

32:01.360 --> 32:06.400
You have to be someone who collaborates openly with other teams within the company

32:06.640 --> 32:11.280
to make sure that you, you know, you, you make things work.

32:11.280 --> 32:15.520
So sales, I don't know anything about salespeople.

32:15.880 --> 32:20.680
I was like, how am I going to do this for Sal me?

32:21.240 --> 32:25.680
But anyway, it's, it's like there's a lot to learn and you also have to be

32:25.680 --> 32:27.400
comfortable with being flexible.

32:27.760 --> 32:31.920
So like I said, I don't know anything about sales, but you have to be comfortable

32:31.920 --> 32:37.520
about not knowing what sales is and being able to take the role and being like, okay,

32:37.520 --> 32:38.640
let's break it down.

32:38.640 --> 32:40.640
What's the first step to achieving this goal?

32:40.640 --> 32:41.760
What do we have to do?

32:41.760 --> 32:42.800
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.360
So I'd say those are difficult.

32:45.360 --> 32:51.440
And also when it comes to like community, community management is not as easy as it looks.

32:51.440 --> 32:55.840
Just having a lot of people in your community, the numbers don't matter.

32:55.840 --> 33:00.640
It, what matters is how are you going to make the community grow?

33:00.720 --> 33:05.040
How are you going to help everyone to grow while using your product?

33:05.040 --> 33:08.560
Because, you know, like with, with community, they are people too.

33:08.560 --> 33:09.600
We are people too.

33:09.600 --> 33:16.480
People get frustrated and it just so happens that it's, it's so hard to, to, to, to, to manage

33:16.480 --> 33:19.440
a community because you always have to think of something else.

33:19.440 --> 33:20.720
How do I make it better?

33:20.720 --> 33:22.240
How do I introduce new things?

33:22.240 --> 33:23.680
Will they like, will they not?

33:24.720 --> 33:27.840
How do we help everyone with questions about Strapi?

33:27.840 --> 33:30.320
Because we, we can't, we can't do that too.

33:30.320 --> 33:31.360
We, we are people.

33:31.360 --> 33:36.560
We, we, yeah, it's just, those are the few things I can, oh yes.

33:36.560 --> 33:42.880
And when it comes to video people, even, even if you are an expert on creating videos,

33:42.880 --> 33:49.840
you will spend, I don't know, there was a time I had to record a simple, simple video on how

33:49.840 --> 33:52.240
you can upgrade just Strapi application.

33:52.800 --> 33:59.120
Believe you me, I sat here at 9am and finally got off my chair, I think at 3pm.

33:59.680 --> 34:02.000
It was a less than three minute video.

34:03.280 --> 34:07.200
And, and I had to like do a lot of pre-shoots and all that stuff.

34:07.200 --> 34:11.440
Like it's, it's, it's, it's like not as simple as it seems.

34:11.440 --> 34:16.800
And also, even after you shoot, you have to get feedback and then do it again.

34:16.800 --> 34:22.160
So it's like, yeah man, this, this, this, this challenges everywhere.

34:22.160 --> 34:27.040
Even with blog writing, the blogs you write, they have to accommodate the community.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.200
It's not about what you like to write about.

34:29.200 --> 34:31.360
It's about what the community needs.

34:31.360 --> 34:36.000
And so you're going to have to write about something you have no clue about.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.720
And so that's, that's on that.

34:39.440 --> 34:42.080
It's, that's my views on that.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.080
Yeah, it's, it's, it's so fascinating.

34:44.080 --> 34:48.720
I, I love this idea because it's so true that there is nothing more difficult

34:48.720 --> 34:50.240
than looking effortless.

34:50.240 --> 34:52.800
Like, uh, people maybe learned this.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.120
I think we still get fooled by it often on like Instagram.

34:55.120 --> 34:57.920
People are like, wow, this person is so glamorous.

34:57.920 --> 35:00.000
They take such amazing photos.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.360
How could that be your first, your, the first selfie you took out of bed?

35:03.360 --> 35:09.520
It's like, it's, it's not got up, put on makeup, set everything up right,

35:09.520 --> 35:13.200
put up lights, took a thousand photos and that was the best one.

35:13.280 --> 35:15.520
Like, you know, but it looks effortless.

35:15.520 --> 35:19.440
And I think good developer relations, good videos and things like that are like that,

35:19.440 --> 35:24.800
right? It's born of a lot of, of iteration, of a lot of retries and a lot of reshoots

35:25.440 --> 35:31.120
to produce something that feels, uh, solid, that feels good, that feels effortless

35:31.120 --> 35:32.160
when somebody watches it.

35:32.160 --> 35:36.160
Doesn't mean that it's perfect, um, but it, but it, but it, it sort of melds.

35:36.160 --> 35:37.760
And I mean, we have that in development too.

35:37.760 --> 35:41.840
I, I like to tell people that like when you get a good designer that puts a good design

35:41.840 --> 35:43.760
together for you, it's like a website.

35:43.760 --> 35:47.360
It's like you can't tell what the HTML elements are that built it.

35:47.360 --> 35:49.600
It just turns into a painting.

35:49.600 --> 35:55.440
And I said, it doesn't take a lot sometimes, a little bit of spacing mess up, a little bit

35:55.440 --> 36:00.160
of style, oddness and the whole cohesiveness of the design fractures.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.480
And you go, that's clearly a div.

36:02.480 --> 36:03.440
That's clearly an input.

36:03.440 --> 36:04.480
That's clearly a button.

36:04.480 --> 36:04.960
That's clear.

36:04.960 --> 36:07.200
And it just turns into all the constituent elements.

36:07.200 --> 36:08.320
So there's just something about that.

36:08.480 --> 36:13.840
Like when, when something finally congeals at the end, it looks well polished.

36:13.840 --> 36:19.520
Um, and, uh, it doesn't take a lot of deviance from that for people to see

36:19.520 --> 36:22.880
behind the scenes of it a little bit, which is, I think is super interesting.

36:23.440 --> 36:25.360
I guess that sounds like that should be intimidating.

36:25.360 --> 36:30.080
I actually get inspired by it because I think it's really cool to find that point

36:30.080 --> 36:31.760
when everything kind of blends together.

36:33.280 --> 36:37.600
I think so too, because from challenges, that's where you learn the most,

36:37.600 --> 36:43.360
you know, it's, it's like, as much as I was intimidated by this whole partnership with

36:43.360 --> 36:46.880
Vercel, I got to learn a lot from it.

36:46.880 --> 36:51.600
Like how you, um, you started actually forming partnership.

36:51.600 --> 36:52.480
What is the point?

36:52.480 --> 36:55.200
What are we trying to do and create sales pipeline?

36:55.200 --> 36:56.240
All that stuff.

36:56.240 --> 36:57.520
Community management.

36:57.520 --> 37:03.520
It gives you that mindset that, you know what, community is more than just the number.

37:03.600 --> 37:11.840
It's more about how you help the people succeed, you know, what it's, it's more than that.

37:11.840 --> 37:13.360
That's, that's what I learned.

37:13.360 --> 37:19.360
And with blogging as well, I mean, as much as I was a blog myself, a blogger myself,

37:19.360 --> 37:24.400
as a hobby, I learned that there's a lot of work that goes into blogging

37:24.400 --> 37:29.280
and how you can make a blog stand out, how you can communicate with your target audience,

37:29.280 --> 37:31.280
how to capture people's attention.

37:31.360 --> 37:35.920
That kind of stuff, I learned that in my role.

37:35.920 --> 37:44.480
And so being flexible too, it does help to, to, to expect the unexpected and learning how to

37:44.480 --> 37:48.160
adapt to those circumstances is really important.

37:48.160 --> 37:55.520
And I would say those are one of the skills I also gained and community and communication

37:55.520 --> 37:58.480
with different departments within the team.

37:59.200 --> 38:06.400
And so it might seem intimidating, but it is for a good cause because it does open your mind

38:06.400 --> 38:09.680
to a lot of things, things that you have never thought about.

38:09.680 --> 38:14.080
And when you face something like that, again, then you know what to do.

38:14.080 --> 38:17.600
And if you face another problem, then it's, it's a learning opportunity.

38:17.600 --> 38:21.360
So I take these challenges as a learning opportunity.

38:22.320 --> 38:25.040
And, you know, I like how this connects to the Twitter piece.

38:25.040 --> 38:28.240
And I think it's maybe part of the reason why you enjoy it is I think one of the

38:28.240 --> 38:32.160
recipes for success in developer relations and advocacy is, is authenticity.

38:32.960 --> 38:39.040
Developers are better than average at sniffing out inauthentic contributors

38:39.040 --> 38:41.840
or brands hiding behind developer relations.

38:41.840 --> 38:46.720
They know when they're being sold to, but they love when they're being related to

38:46.720 --> 38:48.400
and when they're really being engaged.

38:48.400 --> 38:52.800
And so I think that can sometimes be challenging for people at the beginning,

38:52.800 --> 38:56.880
because if you don't feel strong in your own brand or in the brand of the company,

38:57.520 --> 38:59.520
in your approach, that can be tough.

38:59.520 --> 39:02.400
And it can be tough sometimes to sustain.

39:02.400 --> 39:05.440
I tell people like, you can make a discord all you want,

39:05.440 --> 39:07.520
and you can get a couple people to join.

39:07.520 --> 39:10.560
But can you get the conversation to keep going so that it's there in a month?

39:10.560 --> 39:14.160
So that it's there in a year, you know, you can get somebody to read a blog.

39:14.160 --> 39:18.480
But can you create a platform where people will want to keep coming back to read your blogs?

39:18.480 --> 39:19.920
That is hard.

39:19.920 --> 39:21.200
There's not a shortcut for it.

39:21.200 --> 39:22.640
There's no magic recipe for it.

39:22.640 --> 39:27.040
But it is a lot harder, or not harder, again, not to be intimidating.

39:27.040 --> 39:30.160
It's a lot more of a challenge than people might give it credit for.

39:31.600 --> 39:35.440
It's even a slightly different skill set than just producing an individual piece of content,

39:35.440 --> 39:40.480
is to slot that into where is my community that's sort of starting to grow,

39:40.480 --> 39:43.120
and it's starting to smoke and turn into a small flame,

39:43.120 --> 39:47.200
and how do I keep feeding them with more outlets, more videos, more content,

39:47.200 --> 39:48.640
so that it actually catches.

39:48.720 --> 39:52.080
And then to see a community begin to self-sustain,

39:53.040 --> 39:58.240
I mean, that has to be such a feeling of pride and happiness in that job.

39:58.240 --> 40:00.320
I don't know if you've got to experience that as well.

40:02.480 --> 40:05.280
Well, I do experience that.

40:05.280 --> 40:10.960
It's like, I don't know, we must remember that behind these communities,

40:10.960 --> 40:12.720
it's real people.

40:12.720 --> 40:14.240
Those are real people.

40:14.240 --> 40:15.840
The same with Tech Twitter.

40:15.840 --> 40:17.680
Those accounts, the actual people.

40:17.760 --> 40:18.880
I'm an actual person.

40:18.880 --> 40:20.320
I'm not an AI robot.

40:20.880 --> 40:25.360
And so people cannot be programmed to come back for more.

40:25.360 --> 40:26.800
They're not callback functions.

40:27.600 --> 40:28.560
Okay, that was lousy.

40:28.560 --> 40:29.920
I should have said that.

40:29.920 --> 40:38.640
But it's really hard to get someone to come back,

40:38.640 --> 40:42.000
to actually like your things, and come back for more.

40:42.000 --> 40:47.280
And so it's a skill that I think it's so hard to craft,

40:47.280 --> 40:51.520
and to what is the word, to master.

40:51.520 --> 40:56.320
And so it's like you find what people are looking for,

40:56.320 --> 40:58.560
and you pay attention to what people need.

40:59.200 --> 41:02.880
And once you give people what they want,

41:02.880 --> 41:04.800
and they see that you're listening to them,

41:04.800 --> 41:06.960
they see that you hear the cries they're paying,

41:07.600 --> 41:12.720
then I guess that will also help with them being able to trust

41:12.720 --> 41:14.160
that you are doing this for them.

41:14.160 --> 41:16.720
And then they can come back for more.

41:16.720 --> 41:20.560
And if someone else they know are facing similar problems,

41:20.560 --> 41:22.240
they know which community,

41:22.240 --> 41:25.600
which company they can direct those people to.

41:25.600 --> 41:28.720
And that also creates marketing.

41:28.720 --> 41:33.520
You know, word of mouth is the most powerful marketing tool out there.

41:33.520 --> 41:39.600
And so you do want to make sure that the people you are taking care of,

41:39.600 --> 41:43.280
they feel safe, they feel appreciated.

41:43.280 --> 41:46.560
And once they feel the trust, the credibility,

41:46.560 --> 41:50.160
then they have no doubt but to come back.

41:50.160 --> 41:52.880
And yeah, like I said, it's not easy.

41:52.880 --> 41:54.560
I'm not mastering it.

41:54.560 --> 41:56.000
It's something I'm learning to.

41:56.720 --> 41:59.360
And yeah, that's the job.

41:59.360 --> 42:00.640
It's all about learning.

42:00.640 --> 42:02.640
It's all about facing challenges.

42:02.640 --> 42:07.200
And yeah, crying sometimes, but tears of joy.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.480
And that's where the community helps.

42:10.480 --> 42:14.320
You know, what I love about some of the names in the community

42:14.320 --> 42:19.920
that you've talked about is that a lot of them are relatively junior in their careers.

42:19.920 --> 42:24.720
And I love that learning in public became a trend.

42:24.720 --> 42:26.720
And supporting each other, learning in public,

42:26.720 --> 42:29.680
became one of the foundational elements of Tech Twitter.

42:29.680 --> 42:32.560
Again, I know there's a lot of noise out there and a lot of nastiness at times.

42:32.560 --> 42:36.640
But that core of it, I think, is exciting.

42:36.640 --> 42:39.120
Because it does mean that when things are hard,

42:39.120 --> 42:40.880
you at least have some people you can go to and say,

42:40.880 --> 42:41.920
wow, this is really hard.

42:41.920 --> 42:43.440
And people can say, I agree.

42:43.440 --> 42:46.000
It is actually sometimes really hard.

42:46.720 --> 42:50.480
And I like that word that we can at times be a humble community

42:50.480 --> 42:55.120
and not be afraid to admit that sometimes this is overwhelming for all of us.

42:55.120 --> 42:58.400
And so that if you're feeling that way as somebody who's either just starting out

42:58.400 --> 43:02.320
on their self-taught journey or is lost looking for a job right now,

43:03.600 --> 43:07.360
there are a lot of people like you out there that you can connect with

43:08.080 --> 43:09.920
on Twitter or other spaces as well.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.800
Discord's been a great place these days to find those people as well.

43:14.800 --> 43:20.000
Yes, but I must admit, I am actually not as active on Discord.

43:20.000 --> 43:24.800
Like, it's like, Twitter's my cave, like my bad cave.

43:24.800 --> 43:27.280
I'm always on Twitter all the time.

43:27.280 --> 43:28.640
Discord for some reason.

43:28.640 --> 43:33.440
I don't know what, but it's not doing it for me for some reason.

43:34.080 --> 43:35.280
But I do try.

43:35.280 --> 43:39.040
I would say there are a lot of great communities that I've joined on Discord.

43:39.680 --> 43:43.200
For example, the 4C community, which is ran by Francesco.

43:43.600 --> 43:49.040
It also does have a lot of newbies, a lot of people who are interested in tech.

43:49.040 --> 43:54.720
And he also helps them out with resources for learning and for web-free resources.

43:54.720 --> 44:02.000
So that's Francesco and another community is, I think coding newbies does have one too.

44:02.000 --> 44:06.320
On Discord, if I'm not mistaken, the name itself, it says it all,

44:06.320 --> 44:07.200
coding newbies.

44:07.200 --> 44:10.400
So that's a great place to also connect with people.

44:10.400 --> 44:15.920
It might not be people who are like new in tech, but you will find that

44:15.920 --> 44:20.880
someone is learning the exact same thing as you and the conversation can skyrocket

44:20.880 --> 44:25.840
into something else, a great connection, friendship, whatever you would like to name it.

44:25.840 --> 44:28.640
And so Discord does have great communities.

44:28.640 --> 44:30.320
Oh, and Eddie Hub, and Eddie Hub.

44:30.320 --> 44:31.440
How can I forget, Eddie Hub?

44:32.720 --> 44:33.600
Yes, Eddie.

44:34.160 --> 44:38.480
And yeah, those are a few communities I can name the great communities.

44:39.200 --> 44:41.600
And yeah, people use Discord.

44:41.600 --> 44:42.800
Don't be like me.

44:42.800 --> 44:44.080
You'll find a lot of value.

44:45.840 --> 44:46.320
You'll find.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.760
Yeah, use Discord.

44:50.640 --> 44:51.600
It's taste their own.

44:51.600 --> 44:52.960
I mean, I think that's the lesson, right?

44:53.760 --> 44:57.040
Just finding your niche to contribute to any particular platform is find the platform that

44:57.040 --> 44:57.920
works best for you.

44:57.920 --> 45:01.600
I know people who never resonated with any platform they sell, they started contributing

45:01.600 --> 45:02.480
on LinkedIn.

45:02.480 --> 45:04.080
And that's where they found their tribe.

45:04.080 --> 45:06.000
And that's where they really resonated with people.

45:06.000 --> 45:11.440
And it's like, yeah, let's take advantage of the existence of so many social networks and

45:11.440 --> 45:14.240
not feel compelled to necessarily engage with all of them.

45:14.240 --> 45:17.680
But to find the tribe again, that works best for us.

45:18.640 --> 45:19.840
I agree.

45:19.840 --> 45:20.320
I agree.

45:20.320 --> 45:21.200
Thank you so much.

45:21.760 --> 45:26.560
I'm just like, it doesn't help to be everywhere at once.

45:26.560 --> 45:29.760
So just stick with one place that you like.

45:29.760 --> 45:31.680
I grew on Twitter.

45:31.680 --> 45:35.200
I can't imagine starting my growth on LinkedIn.

45:35.200 --> 45:38.000
It's like, well, people are serious.

45:39.120 --> 45:40.720
It's all seriousness.

45:40.720 --> 45:45.760
So it's like, yeah, stick to one platform, grow, make friends there.

45:45.760 --> 45:48.480
And you don't have to worry about anything else.

45:48.480 --> 45:51.760
I guess, you know, just find what works for you.

45:51.760 --> 45:52.560
Don't be pressured.

45:53.840 --> 45:55.280
Now, we're wrapping things up here.

45:55.280 --> 45:57.520
But at the end, we like to ask a little bit of a fun question.

45:57.520 --> 46:01.040
And I happen to see, well, looking into your profile that you are a big

46:01.600 --> 46:02.960
Marvel cinematic universe fan.

46:02.960 --> 46:03.520
Oh, yes.

46:03.520 --> 46:07.600
So at the time that this will come out, it'll be pretty close to when the movie comes out.

46:07.600 --> 46:10.720
But I'm curious, how excited are you for Ant-Man and the Wals?

46:10.720 --> 46:12.800
Are you going to be there day one?

46:13.440 --> 46:14.560
Are you super excited?

46:16.560 --> 46:18.080
Let me tell you something.

46:18.080 --> 46:22.240
I bought the ticket two weeks ago.

46:22.240 --> 46:24.000
That's how prepared I am.

46:24.000 --> 46:29.120
I was like, on Friday, 2pm, because that's the time it's going to play for us.

46:29.120 --> 46:32.160
2pm afternoon, Ant-Man is playing.

46:32.160 --> 46:34.480
And to be honest, I'm actually afraid.

46:40.720 --> 46:43.120
Ant-Man is my favorite.

46:43.680 --> 46:45.760
It's my favorite MCU character.

46:45.760 --> 46:49.040
You will even see on my bio, I have a spider.

46:49.040 --> 46:50.880
I mean, not a spider, an ant.

46:50.880 --> 46:55.120
That ant, a lot of people don't figure it out that, oh, that ant is for Ant-Man.

46:55.120 --> 46:56.480
That emojis for Ant-Man.

46:56.480 --> 47:02.240
So if Ant-Man dies, if Paul Rudd dies, oh, no, people, I don't think I'll recover.

47:02.240 --> 47:06.880
So hopefully it might be, it might be if you're listening to this podcast

47:06.880 --> 47:08.320
that you have now seen the movie.

47:08.880 --> 47:11.360
And so if the unfortunate has happened,

47:11.360 --> 47:14.480
please reach out to Tricia and make sure that she's doing well in her time of mourning.

47:14.480 --> 47:18.000
But I didn't know, I thought that was just because of the movie coming out.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.760
I didn't realize that was more of a global thing.

47:19.760 --> 47:22.480
Well, I wish you luck then watching the movie.

47:22.480 --> 47:25.600
So I will also be there the first weekend,

47:25.600 --> 47:30.480
because I cannot avoid spoilers for very long, you know, there's the downside of social media.

47:30.480 --> 47:32.640
So I need to see things on opening night or else.

47:32.640 --> 47:35.840
The spoilers, the spoilers are so bad.

47:35.840 --> 47:40.560
I tell you, the people who spoil Marvel movies are not Marvel fans.

47:40.560 --> 47:46.560
I said it because if you are a true Marvel fan, you would never spoil that for another fellow person.

47:46.560 --> 47:53.040
So if you are DC, please stop, stop posting, please.

47:54.880 --> 47:56.240
All right, well, we'll leave it there.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.560
We hope that it, we hope that it's enjoyable.

47:58.560 --> 47:59.920
I certainly hope that it's enjoyable as well.

47:59.920 --> 48:01.120
I hope so.

48:01.120 --> 48:04.880
I hope so, dude, like you have no idea how stressed I am.

48:04.880 --> 48:08.080
I'm like, do I, do I have to buy it another time?

48:08.080 --> 48:10.160
Because like, I'm so stressed out.

48:10.160 --> 48:13.600
But anyway, I just hope Paul Rudd doesn't die or anyone doesn't die.

48:14.240 --> 48:19.360
Like, but knowing Marvel in every third movie, someone dies.

48:19.360 --> 48:21.680
So I have to be emotionally prepared.

48:24.320 --> 48:24.800
All right.

48:25.600 --> 48:27.040
Well, that's going to be it for us today.

48:27.040 --> 48:31.200
