00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,960
Hello, everybody, and welcome to the Modern Web Podcast.

5
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,720
My name is Rob O'Sell, and I'm an architect at this.labs.

6
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,240
Today, we are excited to be talking to Trisha Cat, who is a self-taught developer and dev

7
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,320
rel engineer from South Africa.

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,240
Trisha is going to be talking to us about getting started in development and in developer relations

9
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,240
and developer advocacy.

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,880
We're going to be talking about CSS, and who knows, a whole bunch of other topics.

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,080
So Trisha, how are you doing today?

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,720
Hi, Rob.

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,560
Hello, everyone who's listening.

14
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,680
I am doing amazing, I'm doing well, enjoying the weather as always, and yeah, man, I hope

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,840
everyone will enjoy listening to this episode.

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,480
Now talk to people, because when we release this, it's still going to be sort of the

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,760
dead of winter in the United States, and a lot of people might be listening from, and

18
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,240
we just had Groundhog's Day as the time of recording this, who condemned us to six more

19
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,240
weeks of winter.

20
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,960
So can you tell everybody, they're imagining you're enjoying the weather, they're thinking

21
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,200
it's tropical and sunny, wherever you are, can you tell them what's actually happening?

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,920
What's actually happening is I have the lights on inside the house, because it's so

23
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
dark.

24
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,880
It's like, it's like, the clouds are dark, actually, and it's, it's looking like it's

25
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,240
going to be a violent rain.

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,120
So I'm looking forward to all the thunderstorms, the lightning, hopefully it strikes somewhere

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,320
okay, I'm joking, but yeah, man, I'm, I'm that kind of a person, I love rainy weather.

28
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,680
I think it's amazing, it brings water to relaxing, and so I'm looking forward to that.

29
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
Absolutely.

30
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,280
I'm, I'm, I was mentioning this just before we started that I'm the same way, I'm from

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,120
the Midwest, the United States, and I feel like that is our, our calming, healing energy

32
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,360
is just opening all the windows and listening to the rumble of thunder from off in the distance

33
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,800
as it slowly comes up and catches up to you, and you can kind of hear the water as it hits

34
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,200
like a lake or something, and you can hear it moving across the lake until it gets to

35
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
your house.

36
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,480
I mean, that is, that is just childhood in a, in a single image to me.

37
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:47,080
So hopefully you get a, a, an enjoyable storm where you are.

38
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
Thanks.

39
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
I hope I do too.

40
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,080
All right.

41
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,480
Well, let's jump right into it.

42
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,000
And you know, to get us started, I think people are going to be interested to hear about your

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,840
journey, at least just the beginnings of it.

44
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,560
So could you give us like a condensed version of kind of how you came to be in development,

45
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,760
because I think people would be interested to hear how that came to be.

46
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,400
Yes, of course.

47
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:14,440
So Rob mentioned that I am self-taught and I am based in South Africa, which is like

48
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:20,920
the hardest place to actually land your first job as a self-taught without any degree diploma.

49
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:28,560
And so my journey started when I dropped out of college in 2021.

50
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,720
And I decided to self-teach myself with pre-code camp.

51
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,000
And after that, a few months later, I think three months into my starting journey, I'm

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,080
not sure.

53
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:47,640
I landed my first U.S. freelance gig, which I worked on for six months until January 2022,

54
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,320
which was last year.

55
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:55,840
And then after that, I sort of discovered Debrell and what it was and I wanted to join

56
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,560
and be a developer advocate.

57
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:06,240
And months, I think two months, I joined Strapi as a developer advocate intern.

58
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,800
And so that's basically how my journey has started.

59
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,880
It all started with dropping out of college, starting a course in pre-code camp and being

60
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:21,760
exposed to my first remote freelance gig and then lending my internship at Strapi.

61
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:27,440
You know, it's such an interesting decision that I know was difficult at times for you,

62
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,840
because everybody is sort of told, going to college, that's the pathway to your life

63
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,840
working out.

64
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,320
And maybe you're being told that from being a young child and then to decide to drop out

65
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:45,560
to pursue this vision, it's not only difficult, it's a lot of work, but it's got to be difficult

66
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,080
because you were on supposedly a track that was going to inevitably lead to success.

67
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:58,120
So how did you stay focused, motivated, and not want to give up and go back to the path

68
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
that you were on before?

69
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:06,800
Like how did you stay committed to that when sort of that doubt might be crept in?

70
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,000
That's a good question and I must be honest with you, I felt like giving up most of the

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,240
time because I've never actually found anyone who was in the exact same position.

72
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,880
And as I was at that time, who was South African, who was Black South African, who was

73
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,680
working for companies outside of South Africa as a self-taught developer.

74
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:39,520
And so having no one to look out for was difficult on its own because I had no role model.

75
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,880
I had no certainty that whatever I'm doing, is it worth it, must I go back to college?

76
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,720
And I would say what gave me motivation was tech Twitter.

77
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,880
When I saw that other people, even though they were in other provinces, not provinces,

78
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,360
other countries, they also felt the same way in my shoes.

79
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:10,000
And when I saw people posting their good news that they finally landed a role as a self-taught

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,480
developer in some remote company, that just helped me to not give up.

81
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:23,480
It helped me to move forward and it's like, I was like, okay, if it does happen for me,

82
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:29,840
then I can also be a role model for someone who is in the same shoes as I am.

83
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,200
And so I went on ahead, I joined communities, I found like-minded people and those people

84
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,560
helped me to be motivated and they really helped me too much.

85
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,240
And I wouldn't have found that you as a remote freelance role, if it wasn't for the connection

86
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,400
I made with someone else, because that someone referred me to that person and that's how

87
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,360
I got the role.

88
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,200
And so it's all about making great connections.

89
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:04,520
And once you have those great connections, then you have a great motivation to go on.

90
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,960
You know, it's such a great point because when you come up, especially you're starting out

91
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,960
in a self-taught environment, so not necessarily in a program, you're doing it in the pandemic

92
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,960
when we're all already more isolated than we had been in the past, community and finding

93
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
it.

94
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,200
I mean, what an amazing opportunity that you found on Twitter.

95
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,880
But I think I remember reading that your decision to join Twitter was also sort of serendipitous

96
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,080
in some ways.

97
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,760
It wasn't necessarily something that had a ton of forethought or was quite inevitable

98
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
itself.

99
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,360
So how did you decide to stumble into tech Twitter, right?

100
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,480
Because there's a million communities on Twitter.

101
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:52,000
So what made you sort of look there and get on Twitter in the first place?

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay.

103
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So, Twitter.

104
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay.

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,240
So I joined Twitter, I think 2020, that was like my first day in college.

106
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,040
So throughout my life in high school, you can see that I had no social media whatsoever.

107
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:13,560
That's how, I don't know, I was like, anti-social media, I'm not the kind of person who like

108
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,600
social media, I just thought it was a waste of time.

109
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:24,040
Maybe it's my father's mentality talking here, but it's just, and I was like, okay, I need

110
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,480
to like have some social presence because I heard that when people hire somebody, they

111
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:35,440
look out for their social life so that they can see if they have a digital footprint.

112
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,000
And if you don't have a digital footprint, then you are considered weird, like, why don't

113
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,320
you have social media?

114
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,080
And so I was like, okay, let me join Twitter.

115
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,920
And I joined Twitter initially just to like follow some trends and I don't know, like

116
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,520
do all nonsense.

117
00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:01,320
And then after, so okay, so my cousin, she was doing her online business at the time

118
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,840
and she was like, she wants someone to make a website for her and she told me to make

119
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,240
a website for her and then I did the whole Google process.

120
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,960
It's in my blog, I wrote a blog about this, so I'm just like doing a summary.

121
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:23,760
So after that, I found a media travesty, travesty media to do the HTML course.

122
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,960
And then I went to Twitter, I created my account, went to Twitter and I followed Brad

123
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,480
travesty and along with Brad travesty, you know how Twitter suggests some people to follow

124
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,280
and that's how it came to be.

125
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:44,040
And then somehow I got, I saw this hashtag 100 days of code and I clicked on that hashtag

126
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,800
and I saw like what was happening, I see people are learning, people are sharing what

127
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,520
they're learning.

128
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:56,240
And I was like, okay, so this is how I'm going to dip my toes into tech Twitter.

129
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,720
And that didn't happen that same year, I became active on Twitter in 2021 because I joined

130
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,480
in 2020.

131
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:10,280
And so yeah, that's how I did my toes into tech Twitter, 100 days of code became what

132
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
is it?

133
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,080
These code newbies, I follow people, people make connections, comments and everything

134
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:22,200
and then my timeline was filled with web development stuff and that's how I came to be.

135
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,720
And that's my Twitter, my Twitter stuff.

136
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,800
It's so fascinating because yeah, when I got on, I mean, I was on Twitter very early on,

137
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,840
but I didn't use it much at the beginning, it was just sort of a playful thing to keep

138
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
up with news.

139
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:40,520
But when I got on found the tech sphere, I don't know what it was about my mentality

140
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,120
that I just assumed that like all the developers in the universe were at the company I worked

141
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,840
at and the companies my friends worked at.

142
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,320
Like, I don't know why for some reason it just never occurred to me that there must

143
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,080
be hundreds of thousands, millions of us around.

144
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,920
And so getting on to Twitter, it was like, oh, this is such a cool place to find good

145
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,960
blogs to read and to share blogs.

146
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,600
But then it's when you make those connections that you're talking about, like you get on

147
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:11,560
that hashtag and you find somebody who posted their first sample project and they just

148
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,400
ask for advice.

149
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,960
And you know, I got the opportunity to reach out to somebody, they posted their project,

150
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,800
I had a couple of minutes, so I looked at it, I said, oh, this is really great.

151
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,840
Maybe here's some advice and things to look at and followed them.

152
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:29,680
And then, you know, a few months later, they get a project and it's shared by Sarah Drasner

153
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,400
and then they have a, you know, a course that they sell and they're making a bunch of money

154
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,040
and then all of a sudden they get like an amazing job and you're like, that was so cool

155
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,200
to watch somebody blow up like that.

156
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,920
I don't know what it is, but it really is a great place despite all of the other things

157
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,840
going on on the platform.

158
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,280
It's not perfect from end to end, but it's those connections and those moments that I

159
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:59,120
think still make it so worth it for people, even people starting now.

160
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,440
I don't know if you, if you would agree, if you would suggest to somebody get involved

161
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,080
in Twitter if they were just starting today, but I just feel like those connections you

162
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:13,000
can make are so valuable to, you know, finding a job, sure, but even just finding a community

163
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,040
or a network of people or role models to look up to that have, that are walking your, maybe

164
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,680
your similar path.

165
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:27,000
Yes, I definitely agree with you and as someone who has, I might not look it, but I have social

166
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,120
anxiety people, believe me, I am not a social person.

167
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,400
I'm afraid of approaching people, I don't want to disturb anyone's peace.

168
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:44,600
And so when I, I was like starting out with creating connections on Twitter, it usually

169
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:51,440
starts with the comment sections because I'm not someone who DMs people, I don't do that.

170
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,920
It's like, it's too personal, I'm invading a space directly by doing that.

171
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,440
So like the comment sections, 100 days of code, like I said, it's the perfect place

172
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,000
to find people who are like learning the exact same thing as you.

173
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And so that's how like, I started my early connections, I saw someone was learning JavaScript

174
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,880
and they were facing the exact same problem as I was.

175
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:21,000
And I kept on asking questions in the comment section, each time they posted, I look forward

176
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,640
to the post so that I can reply to them and have a conversation from there.

177
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:33,080
And I think like a few months later, that exact same person, like I said, got me the

178
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,440
opportunity to the remote US freelance opportunity.

179
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:45,880
So it's like, it doesn't have to be you approaching big accounts to make great connections.

180
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,000
It's someone small, someone at that small hashtag, someone with two, three likes can

181
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,400
help you in so many ways than someone with, I don't know, like 90k followers.

182
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,840
And so it's really important to not look at the numbers when you're creating connections.

183
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,200
Just look at the person, look at what they are, what they're bringing out and reach out

184
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,440
to them, compliment them, ask them questions, start small and it would lead to something

185
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
big.

186
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:20,160
And so it's a great place to make connections with people outside of your own country because

187
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,640
like Twitter is worldwide.

188
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:29,000
And so it gives you a sense of being open-minded, being introduced to people's different work

189
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,560
cultures and everything.

190
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,560
And so take advantage of it.

191
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,000
That's all I can say.

192
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,560
It's so great to meet another person that has the same opinion on DMs.

193
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,320
I was having that conversation with someone recently.

194
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,360
They were like, how many DMs conversations do you have active at any given point in time?

195
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,040
And I was like, what are you talking about?

196
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,640
Like one every couple months?

197
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,600
And they're like, I have 10 every single day going on.

198
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,800
And I'm like, how?

199
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,960
How does that even happen?

200
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,520
Like, how does that even initiate?

201
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,320
So yeah, I'm really familiar with you.

202
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:11,160
You know, I think it's funny to, I need to sort of break the illusion here of humility

203
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,800
because we need to call attention to the fact that you are knocking on the door as the time

204
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,520
of this recording of 40K followers on Twitter right now.

205
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,880
So you know, all of the things that you're talking about that you've overcome notwithstanding,

206
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,040
it's been very successful for you.

207
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,680
And what I like about that is that, you know, you've done it, as you said, not as someone

208
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,440
who is setting out to become famous or coming to build this with an objective and maybe

209
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,400
not even to necessarily do it with a particular strategy.

210
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,760
You've probably developed things, maybe that work well.

211
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:50,120
But I like that you've built this a bit on the back of being authentic and humorous

212
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,600
and a little bit self-deprecating, but also serious.

213
00:15:52,600 --> 00:16:00,000
So I don't know, can you explain to me, if you try to reflect on it, how that happened

214
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,920
and how you approach Twitter and how you kind of, you know, want to engage with it just

215
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,840
from your own content?

216
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,080
Okay, so how do I overcome?

217
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,800
I don't know.

218
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,640
I can be a weird individual sometimes.

219
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,000
What did you say, self-deprecating?

220
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,000
Sometimes some of your tweets are humorous, but sometimes they're humorous because it's

221
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,920
like, I'll never figure out JavaScript or like, you know, this kind of stuff.

222
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:36,560
So it's very relatable, it's like the thoughts that flip through our mind sometimes in the

223
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,160
midst of a hard problem, you find a way to put them as one line very succinctly on your

224
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
Twitter.

225
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
It's incredibly relatable.

226
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:51,240
I assume that's why so many people have followed you is to the relatability of what you're

227
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,240
putting down there.

228
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,020
Yes, actually, I have been told, but in our honesty, people, if you follow at Trisha

229
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:03,160
KS, please do let me know why you follow me because I don't know why I have no idea

230
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:12,120
why people follow me, but okay, so I would say it's like, okay, I treat Twitter as my,

231
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,880
should I say like my diary, like my confession, like my, like my everything, like where I

232
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,920
trash talk or if I have some unfunny funny jokes, maybe funny jokes for me.

233
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,040
And then I'm like, oh, actually, people are liking this.

234
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,920
It's like, I just post them out.

235
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,280
And also, my tweets are short because I don't like to read long things.

236
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:39,040
I'm not someone who likes to read long stuff, even like threads, unless it's like, it's

237
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,280
really something I have to learn.

238
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,280
I want to understand.

239
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,680
But otherwise, I'm not someone who likes to read a long sentence.

240
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:51,280
Like one sentence that is effective straight to the point touches your soul, you're related

241
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,400
to it, then that's, that's like, that's like good enough for me.

242
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:01,240
And so I always try to keep my tweets short because that's the kind of tweets I would

243
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
like to see.

244
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm not judging anyone on anything.

245
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,160
You are your own person.

246
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
I'm my own person.

247
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,160
I like short things.

248
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,680
You might like long things, but then I do what works for me.

249
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,920
And if you like it, then thank you so much.

250
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,160
I, I don't try to be relatable.

251
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,520
I just, I post things that just randomly go through my mind or the thing I faced for the

252
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,880
day.

253
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:30,320
And so yeah, I, yeah, I guess that's like, that's it on that.

254
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,880
Well, you know, it's interesting because there is something to be said about finding your

255
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,440
style or knowing your style and being authentic.

256
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,060
It's a much easier to be yourself than to, you know, if you were going to approach Twitter

257
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,160
and say, well, it seems like all of tech Twitter is long post and thread.

258
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,440
So I need to find a way to do what I would normally do as long posts and threads.

259
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,760
It wouldn't sound like you.

260
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,720
It maybe wouldn't be interesting to follow.

261
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:58,760
So you know, as you sort of develop that style, like, have you adopted any of what we'll call

262
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,760
the Twitter meta?

263
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,680
Like, have you, have you become more aware of the, the times when posting gets more engagement

264
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,240
or, or is this truly sort of incidental?

265
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,120
Like, you're just posting what you're thinking when you're thinking of it and it's still

266
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,120
connecting.

267
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,280
Well, I would say I'm just, I'm just the person you see people as the person you see

268
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:26,400
on my timeline, I, I, I post what I like, I post what I think, but I will admit starting

269
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,760
my early days of content creation on tech, Twitter, it's, it's, it's really hard to like

270
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:38,280
immediately find a niche, something you, you would like to be known for.

271
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,960
And so I have dipped and doubled on some few things that creating threads.

272
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,720
Like I just said, I don't like threads and I created threads.

273
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:53,040
And I guess I wouldn't say I expressed myself authentically doing that.

274
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,880
And then also, if you are on Twitter, Rob, you, you always, you must have seen people

275
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:04,080
posting eight AI tools and, you know, yeah, you know,

276
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,000
right, exactly.

277
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:13,880
Yeah, the eight AI tools, he has how to find them a thread and all that stuff.

278
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,400
I've tried all of those.

279
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,160
They didn't work for me.

280
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,440
And then I was like, okay, everyone is doing it.

281
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,240
Every account is doing it.

282
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,240
Everyone is like, I don't know how do I set you apart from someone else?

283
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,640
Because it's like, I will follow five people and then post the same thing,

284
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,800
the same syntax, whatever.

285
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,640
I'm saying syntax on Twitter people.

286
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:42,520
I don't know why, but it's like, I had to think of like setting myself apart.

287
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,720
You know, like, what, what is it I would like to be known for?

288
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,360
I don't want to be like everyone else, you know?

289
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,920
And so it's like, okay, what do I like to do?

290
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,520
I like to do CSS.

291
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,120
I like to do CSS code.

292
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,600
I like to do CSS arts.

293
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,320
And then I started by that.

294
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,120
I started sharing my CSS arts.

295
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,960
I started to share my CSS project.

296
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,480
And then from project, it went to CSS puns.

297
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,320
And I was like, hmm, I'm a sucker for dead jokes.

298
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,680
Let me post those and people like them.

299
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,880
And then I was like, hmm, the more I learned JavaScript, I could be able to make a pun

300
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,840
out of JavaScript and make some unfunny jokes.

301
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,760
And then I posted those two.

302
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,600
And so over time, people liked it.

303
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,320
And then I have what, close to 40K followers on Twitter.

304
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,800
I don't know why people, but yes, it's, it's like that.

305
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,320
It took some time.

306
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:41,560
So just, just be yourself, be authentic self, set yourself apart, make people think

307
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,720
about you.

308
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,480
And when they think about you, they must associate something with you.

309
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,120
Like when they think of CSS, they're like, okay, I'm going to follow Tricia.

310
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,840
Sorry, I'm going to follow Tricia or web three.

311
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,160
I'm going to follow Francesco or Denny Thompson.

312
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,080
I'm going to follow for motivation, inspiration, that sort of thing.

313
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,560
And so your goal is to be identified by something and have that something

314
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,120
associated with your name on tech Twitter.

315
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,720
That's my advice.

316
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,480
I can give you on growing on tech to be yourself.

317
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,280
Share your niche and just, just do what you like.

318
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,120
And then people will like you for it.

319
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,040
You don't have to do a lot of things.

320
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,400
It just, it will grow on its own.

321
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,240
Be patient.

322
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
Patience is a big one.

323
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,560
But, you know, I like this idea too that, you know, when everybody is, if

324
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,920
everybody's doing a certain thing, then people feel compelled to do it and they

325
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,680
feel a little bit like you did at the beginning, which is to say, like people

326
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,160
without a community, they say, well, I like weird silly jokes.

327
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,760
And I like not taking things too seriously.

328
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,200
And I like talking about CSS, but everybody's talking about React.

329
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,120
So I guess I need to talk about React on Twitter.

330
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,600
And it's like, you know, I was a, a gamer many years ago, long before it was

331
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,880
quite as mainstream as it was now.

332
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,640
And I remember being in conversations with people and, you know, you're like, oh,

333
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,880
the weather, oh, sports, oh, business.

334
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,440
And you kind of just have in that conversation.

335
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,160
And then maybe it slips that one of you plays a video game.

336
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,000
And then the other person goes, wait, you play, you play video games.

337
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:15,160
And all of a sudden then this, all this animation and, you know, this, this nerd

338
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,760
found another nerd and they have a moment of community and bonding.

339
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,160
And a deeper conversation than they ever would have had.

340
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,040
And you can be that on Twitter, right?

341
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,280
Like you can be that person that is talking about the thing that maybe

342
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,320
nobody else is talking about, but people really want to, but think they're not

343
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:29,920
allowed to.

344
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,480
Uh, and you know, it's like you said, when clearly people were hungry for that

345
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,960
kind of, uh, you know, silliness as well as CSS talk, uh, in a world full of a

346
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,000
lot of JavaScript talks.

347
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,520
So, um, you know, happy that you found a niche.

348
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,920
Maybe not everybody will find quite as potent of a niche, but you'll certainly

349
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,720
enjoy your experience on Twitter a lot more.

350
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,200
You will find your tribe, even if your tribe isn't extremely large, uh, as long

351
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,080
as you're being yourself.

352
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,800
So yeah, absolutely.

353
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,080
Okay.

354
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,960
So then you sort of progress from, from, uh, well, I mean, you're still on Twitter,

355
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,200
but we've progressed the story from, from Twitter to getting a job.

356
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,480
And what's fascinating about your job journey is that you pretty quickly went,

357
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:14,400
um, from self taught developer to developer relations engineer or developer

358
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,760
advocate and, um, you know, this is certainly a career that has over gone a

359
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,880
lot of changes, certainly during the pandemic, but, but over the last many

360
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,880
years as the, as it's matured, um, and, you know, I don't know that there's been a

361
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,760
ton of people talking about starting with developer relations or developer

362
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,520
advocacy as opposed to like maybe, um, switching over to it after a little bit

363
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,480
of time of being a developer.

364
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,480
So can you kind of explain, um, how you, I mean, you talked a little bit about how

365
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,920
you got the job, but kind of how you got into this, uh, this career and how you

366
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,880
sort of, uh, dealt with it coming from maybe not, you know, a 10 year career

367
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,120
being a developer already and kind of what challenges and opportunities that,

368
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,000
that provided for you.

369
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,720
Okay.

370
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:07,760
So how I, I would say how I discovered developer advocacy was because of

371
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,520
Pratham does, there's a user by the name of Pratham.

372
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:18,560
She's an Indian, uh, developer advocate at N host, which is an open source company.

373
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:25,560
I forgot for what, but she is the sole responsible person that I am in developer

374
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,160
advocacy.

375
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,440
Well, I was interested in it.

376
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,000
I am still in interested in it.

377
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:37,000
Um, and so I discovered that last year, like January, February,

378
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:46,400
summer day, and I, what, what really brought me into liking Devra was how it was

379
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,920
described the role of the job.

380
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,760
So the role of the job, basically, it involves, I think, four pillars.

381
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,680
If I'm not mistaken, one is education.

382
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:02,600
So creating content for developers, making sure that they are learning, uh, about the

383
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,720
product they, they are representing.

384
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,440
And so, uh, the education you create is to help developers be successful with the

385
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,520
product they're using.

386
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:16,120
And then the second pillar is marketing, bringing awareness, going to tech conferences,

387
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,440
speaking about the product you're representing.

388
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:27,160
The third thing is, um, if I'm not mistaken, it's community, community management.

389
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,360
So you're going to be engaging a lot with community management, uh, community

390
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,600
members and helping them out.

391
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,360
And, you know, just basically forming relationships with your community.

392
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,720
And then the fourth one is coding.

393
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:48,600
So you must have some technical skill to be able to relate with the community you

394
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,040
are representing for to the company.

395
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,720
And so I was like, that's a nice job.

396
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,360
That is what I am doing as a, as a tech tweeter person.

397
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,640
I'm not an influencer.

398
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,840
I refuse to be known as that.

399
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:12,760
That is what I'm doing here on Twitter.

400
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:21,360
So I, what I, what led me into believing that I can also be a developer advocate was

401
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,560
that I'm so, I have a blog.

402
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,640
I love writing things down.

403
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,520
I, I would say I communicate so much better when I write things down.

404
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,120
It's an actual verbal communication.

405
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,520
And so I love creating content.

406
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,760
I love, uh, showing people how they can use something.

407
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,520
I remember there was a time where Tylen CSS was something new to me.

408
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,240
And I started using it.

409
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,400
And then I went all in to convince people that, hey, leave bootstrap behind.

410
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,080
Bootstrap is not for you.

411
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,400
Go to Tylen CSS.

412
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,720
I will convince you, I will show you.

413
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,080
And that's what I did.

414
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,680
I would make demos and show people that this is how you build a button in less

415
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,280
than five minutes, of course, if my typing speed suffices.

416
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,480
But, you know, I, I used to do those things.

417
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,240
I used to like advocate.

418
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,440
I used to, I, I, I like communicating with people, the community and all that stuff.

419
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,920
I know I said I have social anxiety.

420
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:23,480
I don't like to talk to people, but I do enjoy to talk to somebody to help them

421
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,520
achieve something.

422
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,640
And so I was enjoying that.

423
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,920
And I was like coding.

424
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,800
I, I code.

425
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,760
I love to code.

426
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,520
I would say it's fun.

427
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,960
It's, it's, it's a combination of things that I like.

428
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,760
And I want to experience this field.

429
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,840
I want to work as a developer advocate.

430
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,600
I got the job.

431
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,840
I worked at Strapi.

432
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,800
It was amazing.

433
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,400
It was everything I imagined and even more.

434
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:50,240
And, and so, yeah, man, I, I don't know if I should go on from this point.

435
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,040
But the point is developer advocacy is an amazing role.

436
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:00,080
It's, it's just like you work with people, you meet amazing people.

437
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,720
And you, you get to do the things you like as a job and you get paid for it.

438
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,040
I mean, who gets paid to write blogs for fun?

439
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,400
I mean, I find it writing fun.

440
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,040
And, and you know, it's, it's like, it's a dream position.

441
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:21,560
And also you travel, but I didn't get the chance to, but still you travel because

442
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,320
of your job.

443
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,960
And so it has a lot of con.

444
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,920
No, wait, is it cons or pros?

445
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,720
Which one is good?

446
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,040
Which one is the pros?

447
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,360
OK, it's the pros.

448
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,200
Oh, my God, the pros are good.

449
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,920
That's what I mean.

450
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,040
The pros are good.

451
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,040
That's what I meant.

452
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:44,040
So yeah, it's interesting because, you know, I think I think people have gotten

453
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,200
better in the community of understanding this role a little bit more.

454
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,280
But I think there are still some, maybe perceptions or misperceptions exist.

455
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:58,520
Um, one of them is that, oh, I want to be in DevRel because I would just get

456
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,120
to code demos all day and then travel to conferences and it would be the coolest

457
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,560
job.

458
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,280
I hear a lot of people talking about it the same way they talk about like being

459
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,720
like a Twitch streamer or like a YouTuber.

460
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,720
They're like, oh, I get to play video games all day for a living.

461
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,120
What an amazing life.

462
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,480
And I don't think they fully understand the hard bits behind it, the metrics, the

463
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,960
parts that are not as glamorous, but are difficult.

464
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,800
Um, and other people worry that, you know, if I go to DevRel, maybe all I'll be

465
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,760
doing is blogs or all I'll be doing is talking to people.

466
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,640
I lose all my technical acumen.

467
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,920
I won't grow anymore.

468
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,240
So I wonder if you could speak to both of those perceptions, both that DevRel is

469
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:42,200
this glamorous, enjoyable, never ending fun of all the best parts of development

470
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,600
and none of the hard parts like deadlines and clients.

471
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,240
And the other side of people that feel like it's non-technical and maybe they

472
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,600
would, they would not be as much of a developer or, or struggle in their growth

473
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,360
if they were DevRel.

474
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,600
Okay.

475
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:05,480
So I would say developer relations is, like you said, there are good parts and

476
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,080
then there are bad parts to it.

477
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,400
But for me personally speaking, oh no, personally speaking for myself, I would

478
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:18,480
say the bad part is there's a lot of things going on.

479
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,640
Like as much as the schedule, like you don't know how your day is going to go,

480
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,960
which is awesome.

481
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,720
I, I like that about it.

482
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,760
But at the same time, it's like, you don't know how your day is going to go.

483
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,840
And you have so much to learn.

484
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,680
There's a lot of things to learn.

485
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,640
And I remember there was, I, we were working on an initiative at Strapi.

486
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,160
And one of the initiatives was to form a partnership with Versell.

487
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,800
And it's not exactly marketing.

488
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:54,400
It's not exactly, you know, community and, and, um, you know, education.

489
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,680
It's more like sales.

490
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,360
So you have to like get into other departments and to work with other teams.

491
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,400
You have to be someone who collaborates openly with other teams within the company

492
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,280
to make sure that you, you know, you, you make things work.

493
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,520
So sales, I don't know anything about salespeople.

494
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,680
I was like, how am I going to do this for Sal me?

495
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,680
But anyway, it's, it's like there's a lot to learn and you also have to be

496
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,400
comfortable with being flexible.

497
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,920
So like I said, I don't know anything about sales, but you have to be comfortable

498
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:37,520
about not knowing what sales is and being able to take the role and being like, okay,

499
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,640
let's break it down.

500
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,640
What's the first step to achieving this goal?

501
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,760
What do we have to do?

502
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,800
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

503
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,360
So I'd say those are difficult.

504
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,440
And also when it comes to like community, community management is not as easy as it looks.

505
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,840
Just having a lot of people in your community, the numbers don't matter.

506
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,640
It, what matters is how are you going to make the community grow?

507
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,040
How are you going to help everyone to grow while using your product?

508
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,560
Because, you know, like with, with community, they are people too.

509
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,600
We are people too.

510
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:16,480
People get frustrated and it just so happens that it's, it's so hard to, to, to, to, to manage

511
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,440
a community because you always have to think of something else.

512
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,720
How do I make it better?

513
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,240
How do I introduce new things?

514
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,680
Will they like, will they not?

515
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,840
How do we help everyone with questions about Strapi?

516
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,320
Because we, we can't, we can't do that too.

517
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,360
We, we are people.

518
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,560
We, we, yeah, it's just, those are the few things I can, oh yes.

519
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:42,880
And when it comes to video people, even, even if you are an expert on creating videos,

520
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,840
you will spend, I don't know, there was a time I had to record a simple, simple video on how

521
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,240
you can upgrade just Strapi application.

522
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:59,120
Believe you me, I sat here at 9am and finally got off my chair, I think at 3pm.

523
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,000
It was a less than three minute video.

524
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,200
And, and I had to like do a lot of pre-shoots and all that stuff.

525
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,440
Like it's, it's, it's, it's like not as simple as it seems.

526
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,800
And also, even after you shoot, you have to get feedback and then do it again.

527
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,160
So it's like, yeah man, this, this, this, this challenges everywhere.

528
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:27,040
Even with blog writing, the blogs you write, they have to accommodate the community.

529
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,200
It's not about what you like to write about.

530
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,360
It's about what the community needs.

531
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:36,000
And so you're going to have to write about something you have no clue about.

532
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,720
And so that's, that's on that.

533
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,080
It's, that's my views on that.

534
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,080
Yeah, it's, it's, it's so fascinating.

535
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,720
I, I love this idea because it's so true that there is nothing more difficult

536
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,240
than looking effortless.

537
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,800
Like, uh, people maybe learned this.

538
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,120
I think we still get fooled by it often on like Instagram.

539
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,920
People are like, wow, this person is so glamorous.

540
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,000
They take such amazing photos.

541
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,360
How could that be your first, your, the first selfie you took out of bed?

542
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:09,520
It's like, it's, it's not got up, put on makeup, set everything up right,

543
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,200
put up lights, took a thousand photos and that was the best one.

544
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,520
Like, you know, but it looks effortless.

545
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,440
And I think good developer relations, good videos and things like that are like that,

546
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,800
right? It's born of a lot of, of iteration, of a lot of retries and a lot of reshoots

547
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:31,120
to produce something that feels, uh, solid, that feels good, that feels effortless

548
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,160
when somebody watches it.

549
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,160
Doesn't mean that it's perfect, um, but it, but it, but it, it sort of melds.

550
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,760
And I mean, we have that in development too.

551
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,840
I, I like to tell people that like when you get a good designer that puts a good design

552
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,760
together for you, it's like a website.

553
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,360
It's like you can't tell what the HTML elements are that built it.

554
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,600
It just turns into a painting.

555
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:55,440
And I said, it doesn't take a lot sometimes, a little bit of spacing mess up, a little bit

556
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,160
of style, oddness and the whole cohesiveness of the design fractures.

557
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,480
And you go, that's clearly a div.

558
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,440
That's clearly an input.

559
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,480
That's clearly a button.

560
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,960
That's clear.

561
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,200
And it just turns into all the constituent elements.

562
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,320
So there's just something about that.

563
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,840
Like when, when something finally congeals at the end, it looks well polished.

564
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:19,520
Um, and, uh, it doesn't take a lot of deviance from that for people to see

565
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,880
behind the scenes of it a little bit, which is, I think is super interesting.

566
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,360
I guess that sounds like that should be intimidating.

567
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:30,080
I actually get inspired by it because I think it's really cool to find that point

568
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,760
when everything kind of blends together.

569
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,600
I think so too, because from challenges, that's where you learn the most,

570
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:43,360
you know, it's, it's like, as much as I was intimidated by this whole partnership with

571
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,880
Vercel, I got to learn a lot from it.

572
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,600
Like how you, um, you started actually forming partnership.

573
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,480
What is the point?

574
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,200
What are we trying to do and create sales pipeline?

575
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,240
All that stuff.

576
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,520
Community management.

577
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,520
It gives you that mindset that, you know what, community is more than just the number.

578
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:11,840
It's more about how you help the people succeed, you know, what it's, it's more than that.

579
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,360
That's, that's what I learned.

580
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:19,360
And with blogging as well, I mean, as much as I was a blog myself, a blogger myself,

581
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:24,400
as a hobby, I learned that there's a lot of work that goes into blogging

582
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,280
and how you can make a blog stand out, how you can communicate with your target audience,

583
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,280
how to capture people's attention.

584
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,920
That kind of stuff, I learned that in my role.

585
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:44,480
And so being flexible too, it does help to, to, to expect the unexpected and learning how to

586
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,160
adapt to those circumstances is really important.

587
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:55,520
And I would say those are one of the skills I also gained and community and communication

588
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,480
with different departments within the team.

589
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:06,400
And so it might seem intimidating, but it is for a good cause because it does open your mind

590
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,680
to a lot of things, things that you have never thought about.

591
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,080
And when you face something like that, again, then you know what to do.

592
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,600
And if you face another problem, then it's, it's a learning opportunity.

593
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,360
So I take these challenges as a learning opportunity.

594
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,040
And, you know, I like how this connects to the Twitter piece.

595
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,240
And I think it's maybe part of the reason why you enjoy it is I think one of the

596
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,160
recipes for success in developer relations and advocacy is, is authenticity.

597
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:39,040
Developers are better than average at sniffing out inauthentic contributors

598
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,840
or brands hiding behind developer relations.

599
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,720
They know when they're being sold to, but they love when they're being related to

600
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,400
and when they're really being engaged.

601
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,800
And so I think that can sometimes be challenging for people at the beginning,

602
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,880
because if you don't feel strong in your own brand or in the brand of the company,

603
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,520
in your approach, that can be tough.

604
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,400
And it can be tough sometimes to sustain.

605
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,440
I tell people like, you can make a discord all you want,

606
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,520
and you can get a couple people to join.

607
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,560
But can you get the conversation to keep going so that it's there in a month?

608
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,160
So that it's there in a year, you know, you can get somebody to read a blog.

609
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,480
But can you create a platform where people will want to keep coming back to read your blogs?

610
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,920
That is hard.

611
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,200
There's not a shortcut for it.

612
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,640
There's no magic recipe for it.

613
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,040
But it is a lot harder, or not harder, again, not to be intimidating.

614
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,160
It's a lot more of a challenge than people might give it credit for.

615
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,440
It's even a slightly different skill set than just producing an individual piece of content,

616
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,480
is to slot that into where is my community that's sort of starting to grow,

617
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,120
and it's starting to smoke and turn into a small flame,

618
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,200
and how do I keep feeding them with more outlets, more videos, more content,

619
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,640
so that it actually catches.

620
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,080
And then to see a community begin to self-sustain,

621
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,240
I mean, that has to be such a feeling of pride and happiness in that job.

622
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,320
I don't know if you've got to experience that as well.

623
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,280
Well, I do experience that.

624
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,960
It's like, I don't know, we must remember that behind these communities,

625
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,720
it's real people.

626
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,240
Those are real people.

627
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,840
The same with Tech Twitter.

628
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,680
Those accounts, the actual people.

629
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,880
I'm an actual person.

630
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,320
I'm not an AI robot.

631
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,360
And so people cannot be programmed to come back for more.

632
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,800
They're not callback functions.

633
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,560
Okay, that was lousy.

634
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,920
I should have said that.

635
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:38,640
But it's really hard to get someone to come back,

636
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,000
to actually like your things, and come back for more.

637
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,280
And so it's a skill that I think it's so hard to craft,

638
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,520
and to what is the word, to master.

639
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,320
And so it's like you find what people are looking for,

640
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,560
and you pay attention to what people need.

641
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,880
And once you give people what they want,

642
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,800
and they see that you're listening to them,

643
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,960
they see that you hear the cries they're paying,

644
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,720
then I guess that will also help with them being able to trust

645
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,160
that you are doing this for them.

646
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,720
And then they can come back for more.

647
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,560
And if someone else they know are facing similar problems,

648
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,240
they know which community,

649
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,600
which company they can direct those people to.

650
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,720
And that also creates marketing.

651
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,520
You know, word of mouth is the most powerful marketing tool out there.

652
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:39,600
And so you do want to make sure that the people you are taking care of,

653
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,280
they feel safe, they feel appreciated.

654
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,560
And once they feel the trust, the credibility,

655
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,160
then they have no doubt but to come back.

656
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,880
And yeah, like I said, it's not easy.

657
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,560
I'm not mastering it.

658
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,000
It's something I'm learning to.

659
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,360
And yeah, that's the job.

660
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,640
It's all about learning.

661
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,640
It's all about facing challenges.

662
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,200
And yeah, crying sometimes, but tears of joy.

663
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,480
And that's where the community helps.

664
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,320
You know, what I love about some of the names in the community

665
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,920
that you've talked about is that a lot of them are relatively junior in their careers.

666
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,720
And I love that learning in public became a trend.

667
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,720
And supporting each other, learning in public,

668
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,680
became one of the foundational elements of Tech Twitter.

669
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,560
Again, I know there's a lot of noise out there and a lot of nastiness at times.

670
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,640
But that core of it, I think, is exciting.

671
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,120
Because it does mean that when things are hard,

672
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,880
you at least have some people you can go to and say,

673
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,920
wow, this is really hard.

674
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,440
And people can say, I agree.

675
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,000
It is actually sometimes really hard.

676
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,480
And I like that word that we can at times be a humble community

677
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,120
and not be afraid to admit that sometimes this is overwhelming for all of us.

678
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,400
And so that if you're feeling that way as somebody who's either just starting out

679
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,320
on their self-taught journey or is lost looking for a job right now,

680
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,360
there are a lot of people like you out there that you can connect with

681
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,920
on Twitter or other spaces as well.

682
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,800
Discord's been a great place these days to find those people as well.

683
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,000
Yes, but I must admit, I am actually not as active on Discord.

684
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,800
Like, it's like, Twitter's my cave, like my bad cave.

685
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,280
I'm always on Twitter all the time.

686
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,640
Discord for some reason.

687
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,440
I don't know what, but it's not doing it for me for some reason.

688
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,280
But I do try.

689
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,040
I would say there are a lot of great communities that I've joined on Discord.

690
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,200
For example, the 4C community, which is ran by Francesco.

691
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:49,040
It also does have a lot of newbies, a lot of people who are interested in tech.

692
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,720
And he also helps them out with resources for learning and for web-free resources.

693
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:02,000
So that's Francesco and another community is, I think coding newbies does have one too.

694
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,320
On Discord, if I'm not mistaken, the name itself, it says it all,

695
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,200
coding newbies.

696
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,400
So that's a great place to also connect with people.

697
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,920
It might not be people who are like new in tech, but you will find that

698
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,880
someone is learning the exact same thing as you and the conversation can skyrocket

699
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,840
into something else, a great connection, friendship, whatever you would like to name it.

700
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,640
And so Discord does have great communities.

701
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,320
Oh, and Eddie Hub, and Eddie Hub.

702
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,440
How can I forget, Eddie Hub?

703
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,600
Yes, Eddie.

704
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,480
And yeah, those are a few communities I can name the great communities.

705
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,600
And yeah, people use Discord.

706
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,800
Don't be like me.

707
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,080
You'll find a lot of value.

708
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,320
You'll find.

709
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,760
Yeah, use Discord.

710
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,600
It's taste their own.

711
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,960
I mean, I think that's the lesson, right?

712
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,040
Just finding your niche to contribute to any particular platform is find the platform that

713
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,920
works best for you.

714
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,600
I know people who never resonated with any platform they sell, they started contributing

715
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,480
on LinkedIn.

716
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,080
And that's where they found their tribe.

717
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,000
And that's where they really resonated with people.

718
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,440
And it's like, yeah, let's take advantage of the existence of so many social networks and

719
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,240
not feel compelled to necessarily engage with all of them.

720
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,680
But to find the tribe again, that works best for us.

721
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,840
I agree.

722
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,320
I agree.

723
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,200
Thank you so much.

724
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,560
I'm just like, it doesn't help to be everywhere at once.

725
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,760
So just stick with one place that you like.

726
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,680
I grew on Twitter.

727
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,200
I can't imagine starting my growth on LinkedIn.

728
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,000
It's like, well, people are serious.

729
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,720
It's all seriousness.

730
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:45,760
So it's like, yeah, stick to one platform, grow, make friends there.

731
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,480
And you don't have to worry about anything else.

732
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,760
I guess, you know, just find what works for you.

733
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,560
Don't be pressured.

734
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,280
Now, we're wrapping things up here.

735
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,520
But at the end, we like to ask a little bit of a fun question.

736
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,040
And I happen to see, well, looking into your profile that you are a big

737
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,960
Marvel cinematic universe fan.

738
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,520
Oh, yes.

739
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,600
So at the time that this will come out, it'll be pretty close to when the movie comes out.

740
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,720
But I'm curious, how excited are you for Ant-Man and the Wals?

741
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,800
Are you going to be there day one?

742
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,560
Are you super excited?

743
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,080
Let me tell you something.

744
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:22,240
I bought the ticket two weeks ago.

745
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,000
That's how prepared I am.

746
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,120
I was like, on Friday, 2pm, because that's the time it's going to play for us.

747
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,160
2pm afternoon, Ant-Man is playing.

748
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,480
And to be honest, I'm actually afraid.

749
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,120
Ant-Man is my favorite.

750
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,760
It's my favorite MCU character.

751
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,040
You will even see on my bio, I have a spider.

752
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,880
I mean, not a spider, an ant.

753
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,120
That ant, a lot of people don't figure it out that, oh, that ant is for Ant-Man.

754
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,480
That emojis for Ant-Man.

755
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,240
So if Ant-Man dies, if Paul Rudd dies, oh, no, people, I don't think I'll recover.

756
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:06,880
So hopefully it might be, it might be if you're listening to this podcast

757
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,320
that you have now seen the movie.

758
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,360
And so if the unfortunate has happened,

759
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,480
please reach out to Tricia and make sure that she's doing well in her time of mourning.

760
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,000
But I didn't know, I thought that was just because of the movie coming out.

761
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,760
I didn't realize that was more of a global thing.

762
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,480
Well, I wish you luck then watching the movie.

763
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,600
So I will also be there the first weekend,

764
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,480
because I cannot avoid spoilers for very long, you know, there's the downside of social media.

765
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,640
So I need to see things on opening night or else.

766
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,840
The spoilers, the spoilers are so bad.

767
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:40,560
I tell you, the people who spoil Marvel movies are not Marvel fans.

768
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:46,560
I said it because if you are a true Marvel fan, you would never spoil that for another fellow person.

769
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:53,040
So if you are DC, please stop, stop posting, please.

770
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,240
All right, well, we'll leave it there.

771
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,560
We hope that it, we hope that it's enjoyable.

772
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,920
I certainly hope that it's enjoyable as well.

773
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,120
I hope so.

774
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,880
I hope so, dude, like you have no idea how stressed I am.

775
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,080
I'm like, do I, do I have to buy it another time?

776
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,160
Because like, I'm so stressed out.

777
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,600
But anyway, I just hope Paul Rudd doesn't die or anyone doesn't die.

778
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,360
Like, but knowing Marvel in every third movie, someone dies.

779
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,680
So I have to be emotionally prepared.

780
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:24,800
All right.

781
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,040
Well, that's going to be it for us today.

782
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,200
