35960	39960	Hello, everybody, and welcome to the Modern Web Podcast.
39960	42720	My name is Rob O'Sell, and I'm an architect at this.labs.
42720	48240	Today, we are excited to be talking to Trisha Cat, who is a self-taught developer and dev
48240	50320	rel engineer from South Africa.
50320	55240	Trisha is going to be talking to us about getting started in development and in developer relations
55240	56240	and developer advocacy.
56240	59880	We're going to be talking about CSS, and who knows, a whole bunch of other topics.
59880	62080	So Trisha, how are you doing today?
62080	63720	Hi, Rob.
63720	65560	Hello, everyone who's listening.
65560	71680	I am doing amazing, I'm doing well, enjoying the weather as always, and yeah, man, I hope
71680	74840	everyone will enjoy listening to this episode.
74840	79480	Now talk to people, because when we release this, it's still going to be sort of the
79480	85760	dead of winter in the United States, and a lot of people might be listening from, and
85760	90240	we just had Groundhog's Day as the time of recording this, who condemned us to six more
90240	91240	weeks of winter.
91240	95960	So can you tell everybody, they're imagining you're enjoying the weather, they're thinking
95960	101200	it's tropical and sunny, wherever you are, can you tell them what's actually happening?
101200	105920	What's actually happening is I have the lights on inside the house, because it's so
105920	106920	dark.
106920	112880	It's like, it's like, the clouds are dark, actually, and it's, it's looking like it's
112880	115240	going to be a violent rain.
115240	120120	So I'm looking forward to all the thunderstorms, the lightning, hopefully it strikes somewhere
120120	125320	okay, I'm joking, but yeah, man, I'm, I'm that kind of a person, I love rainy weather.
125320	130680	I think it's amazing, it brings water to relaxing, and so I'm looking forward to that.
130680	131680	Absolutely.
131680	135280	I'm, I'm, I was mentioning this just before we started that I'm the same way, I'm from
135280	141120	the Midwest, the United States, and I feel like that is our, our calming, healing energy
141120	146360	is just opening all the windows and listening to the rumble of thunder from off in the distance
146360	151800	as it slowly comes up and catches up to you, and you can kind of hear the water as it hits
151800	155200	like a lake or something, and you can hear it moving across the lake until it gets to
155200	156200	your house.
156200	160480	I mean, that is, that is just childhood in a, in a single image to me.
160480	167080	So hopefully you get a, a, an enjoyable storm where you are.
167080	168080	Thanks.
168080	169080	I hope I do too.
169080	170080	All right.
170080	171480	Well, let's jump right into it.
171480	175000	And you know, to get us started, I think people are going to be interested to hear about your
175000	176840	journey, at least just the beginnings of it.
176840	182560	So could you give us like a condensed version of kind of how you came to be in development,
182560	185760	because I think people would be interested to hear how that came to be.
186240	187400	Yes, of course.
187400	194440	So Rob mentioned that I am self-taught and I am based in South Africa, which is like
194440	200920	the hardest place to actually land your first job as a self-taught without any degree diploma.
200920	208560	And so my journey started when I dropped out of college in 2021.
208560	212720	And I decided to self-teach myself with pre-code camp.
212760	218000	And after that, a few months later, I think three months into my starting journey, I'm
218000	219080	not sure.
219080	227640	I landed my first U.S. freelance gig, which I worked on for six months until January 2022,
227640	229320	which was last year.
229320	235840	And then after that, I sort of discovered Debrell and what it was and I wanted to join
235840	238560	and be a developer advocate.
238560	246240	And months, I think two months, I joined Strapi as a developer advocate intern.
246240	249800	And so that's basically how my journey has started.
249800	254880	It all started with dropping out of college, starting a course in pre-code camp and being
254880	261760	exposed to my first remote freelance gig and then lending my internship at Strapi.
261760	267440	You know, it's such an interesting decision that I know was difficult at times for you,
267440	273840	because everybody is sort of told, going to college, that's the pathway to your life
273840	274840	working out.
274840	279320	And maybe you're being told that from being a young child and then to decide to drop out
279320	285560	to pursue this vision, it's not only difficult, it's a lot of work, but it's got to be difficult
285560	291080	because you were on supposedly a track that was going to inevitably lead to success.
291080	298120	So how did you stay focused, motivated, and not want to give up and go back to the path
298120	299120	that you were on before?
299120	306800	Like how did you stay committed to that when sort of that doubt might be crept in?
306800	313000	That's a good question and I must be honest with you, I felt like giving up most of the
313000	320240	time because I've never actually found anyone who was in the exact same position.
320240	325880	And as I was at that time, who was South African, who was Black South African, who was
325880	331680	working for companies outside of South Africa as a self-taught developer.
331680	339520	And so having no one to look out for was difficult on its own because I had no role model.
339520	345880	I had no certainty that whatever I'm doing, is it worth it, must I go back to college?
345880	351720	And I would say what gave me motivation was tech Twitter.
351720	356880	When I saw that other people, even though they were in other provinces, not provinces,
356880	362360	other countries, they also felt the same way in my shoes.
362360	370000	And when I saw people posting their good news that they finally landed a role as a self-taught
370000	375480	developer in some remote company, that just helped me to not give up.
375480	383480	It helped me to move forward and it's like, I was like, okay, if it does happen for me,
383480	389840	then I can also be a role model for someone who is in the same shoes as I am.
389840	395200	And so I went on ahead, I joined communities, I found like-minded people and those people
395200	400560	helped me to be motivated and they really helped me too much.
400560	407240	And I wouldn't have found that you as a remote freelance role, if it wasn't for the connection
407240	412400	I made with someone else, because that someone referred me to that person and that's how
412400	413360	I got the role.
413360	418200	And so it's all about making great connections.
418200	424520	And once you have those great connections, then you have a great motivation to go on.
425520	431960	You know, it's such a great point because when you come up, especially you're starting out
431960	435960	in a self-taught environment, so not necessarily in a program, you're doing it in the pandemic
435960	441960	when we're all already more isolated than we had been in the past, community and finding
441960	442960	it.
442960	447200	I mean, what an amazing opportunity that you found on Twitter.
447200	451880	But I think I remember reading that your decision to join Twitter was also sort of serendipitous
451880	454080	in some ways.
454080	458760	It wasn't necessarily something that had a ton of forethought or was quite inevitable
458760	459760	itself.
459760	464360	So how did you decide to stumble into tech Twitter, right?
464360	466480	Because there's a million communities on Twitter.
466480	472000	So what made you sort of look there and get on Twitter in the first place?
472000	473000	Okay.
473000	474000	So, Twitter.
474000	475000	Okay.
475000	481240	So I joined Twitter, I think 2020, that was like my first day in college.
481240	487040	So throughout my life in high school, you can see that I had no social media whatsoever.
487040	493560	That's how, I don't know, I was like, anti-social media, I'm not the kind of person who like
493560	496600	social media, I just thought it was a waste of time.
496600	504040	Maybe it's my father's mentality talking here, but it's just, and I was like, okay, I need
504040	509480	to like have some social presence because I heard that when people hire somebody, they
509480	515440	look out for their social life so that they can see if they have a digital footprint.
515440	521000	And if you don't have a digital footprint, then you are considered weird, like, why don't
521000	522320	you have social media?
522320	526080	And so I was like, okay, let me join Twitter.
526080	531920	And I joined Twitter initially just to like follow some trends and I don't know, like
531920	533520	do all nonsense.
533520	541320	And then after, so okay, so my cousin, she was doing her online business at the time
541320	545840	and she was like, she wants someone to make a website for her and she told me to make
545840	549240	a website for her and then I did the whole Google process.
549240	554960	It's in my blog, I wrote a blog about this, so I'm just like doing a summary.
554960	563760	So after that, I found a media travesty, travesty media to do the HTML course.
563760	568960	And then I went to Twitter, I created my account, went to Twitter and I followed Brad
568960	574480	travesty and along with Brad travesty, you know how Twitter suggests some people to follow
574480	577280	and that's how it came to be.
577280	584040	And then somehow I got, I saw this hashtag 100 days of code and I clicked on that hashtag
584040	587800	and I saw like what was happening, I see people are learning, people are sharing what
587800	589520	they're learning.
589520	596240	And I was like, okay, so this is how I'm going to dip my toes into tech Twitter.
596240	601720	And that didn't happen that same year, I became active on Twitter in 2021 because I joined
601720	603480	in 2020.
603480	610280	And so yeah, that's how I did my toes into tech Twitter, 100 days of code became what
610280	611280	is it?
611280	616080	These code newbies, I follow people, people make connections, comments and everything
616080	622200	and then my timeline was filled with web development stuff and that's how I came to be.
622200	625720	And that's my Twitter, my Twitter stuff.
625720	630800	It's so fascinating because yeah, when I got on, I mean, I was on Twitter very early on,
630800	633840	but I didn't use it much at the beginning, it was just sort of a playful thing to keep
633840	634840	up with news.
634840	640520	But when I got on found the tech sphere, I don't know what it was about my mentality
640520	645120	that I just assumed that like all the developers in the universe were at the company I worked
645120	646840	at and the companies my friends worked at.
646840	650320	Like, I don't know why for some reason it just never occurred to me that there must
650320	654080	be hundreds of thousands, millions of us around.
654080	657920	And so getting on to Twitter, it was like, oh, this is such a cool place to find good
657920	660960	blogs to read and to share blogs.
660960	664600	But then it's when you make those connections that you're talking about, like you get on
664600	671560	that hashtag and you find somebody who posted their first sample project and they just
671560	673400	ask for advice.
673400	676960	And you know, I got the opportunity to reach out to somebody, they posted their project,
676960	679800	I had a couple of minutes, so I looked at it, I said, oh, this is really great.
679800	683840	Maybe here's some advice and things to look at and followed them.
683840	689680	And then, you know, a few months later, they get a project and it's shared by Sarah Drasner
689680	693400	and then they have a, you know, a course that they sell and they're making a bunch of money
693400	698040	and then all of a sudden they get like an amazing job and you're like, that was so cool
698040	700200	to watch somebody blow up like that.
700200	705920	I don't know what it is, but it really is a great place despite all of the other things
705920	707840	going on on the platform.
707840	713280	It's not perfect from end to end, but it's those connections and those moments that I
713280	719120	think still make it so worth it for people, even people starting now.
719120	722440	I don't know if you, if you would agree, if you would suggest to somebody get involved
722440	727080	in Twitter if they were just starting today, but I just feel like those connections you
727080	733000	can make are so valuable to, you know, finding a job, sure, but even just finding a community
733000	738040	or a network of people or role models to look up to that have, that are walking your, maybe
738040	739680	your similar path.
739680	747000	Yes, I definitely agree with you and as someone who has, I might not look it, but I have social
747000	753120	anxiety people, believe me, I am not a social person.
753120	757400	I'm afraid of approaching people, I don't want to disturb anyone's peace.
757400	764600	And so when I, I was like starting out with creating connections on Twitter, it usually
764600	771440	starts with the comment sections because I'm not someone who DMs people, I don't do that.
771440	775920	It's like, it's too personal, I'm invading a space directly by doing that.
775920	781440	So like the comment sections, 100 days of code, like I said, it's the perfect place
781440	786000	to find people who are like learning the exact same thing as you.
786000	792000	And so that's how like, I started my early connections, I saw someone was learning JavaScript
792000	795880	and they were facing the exact same problem as I was.
795880	801000	And I kept on asking questions in the comment section, each time they posted, I look forward
801000	806640	to the post so that I can reply to them and have a conversation from there.
806640	813080	And I think like a few months later, that exact same person, like I said, got me the
813080	818440	opportunity to the remote US freelance opportunity.
818440	825880	So it's like, it doesn't have to be you approaching big accounts to make great connections.
825880	831000	It's someone small, someone at that small hashtag, someone with two, three likes can
831000	837400	help you in so many ways than someone with, I don't know, like 90k followers.
837400	842840	And so it's really important to not look at the numbers when you're creating connections.
842840	847200	Just look at the person, look at what they are, what they're bringing out and reach out
847200	852440	to them, compliment them, ask them questions, start small and it would lead to something
852440	853440	big.
853440	860160	And so it's a great place to make connections with people outside of your own country because
860160	862640	like Twitter is worldwide.
862640	869000	And so it gives you a sense of being open-minded, being introduced to people's different work
869000	870560	cultures and everything.
870560	873560	And so take advantage of it.
873560	877000	That's all I can say.
877000	880560	It's so great to meet another person that has the same opinion on DMs.
880560	883320	I was having that conversation with someone recently.
883320	887360	They were like, how many DMs conversations do you have active at any given point in time?
887360	889040	And I was like, what are you talking about?
889040	890640	Like one every couple months?
890640	893600	And they're like, I have 10 every single day going on.
893600	895800	And I'm like, how?
895800	896960	How does that even happen?
896960	899520	Like, how does that even initiate?
899520	902320	So yeah, I'm really familiar with you.
902320	911160	You know, I think it's funny to, I need to sort of break the illusion here of humility
911160	915800	because we need to call attention to the fact that you are knocking on the door as the time
915800	920520	of this recording of 40K followers on Twitter right now.
920520	925880	So you know, all of the things that you're talking about that you've overcome notwithstanding,
925880	928040	it's been very successful for you.
928080	933680	And what I like about that is that, you know, you've done it, as you said, not as someone
933680	939440	who is setting out to become famous or coming to build this with an objective and maybe
939440	942400	not even to necessarily do it with a particular strategy.
942400	944760	You've probably developed things, maybe that work well.
944760	950120	But I like that you've built this a bit on the back of being authentic and humorous
950120	952600	and a little bit self-deprecating, but also serious.
952600	960000	So I don't know, can you explain to me, if you try to reflect on it, how that happened
960000	964920	and how you approach Twitter and how you kind of, you know, want to engage with it just
964920	966840	from your own content?
968480	972080	Okay, so how do I overcome?
972080	973800	I don't know.
973800	976640	I can be a weird individual sometimes.
976640	981000	What did you say, self-deprecating?
981840	985000	Sometimes some of your tweets are humorous, but sometimes they're humorous because it's
985000	988920	like, I'll never figure out JavaScript or like, you know, this kind of stuff.
988920	996560	So it's very relatable, it's like the thoughts that flip through our mind sometimes in the
996560	1003160	midst of a hard problem, you find a way to put them as one line very succinctly on your
1003160	1004160	Twitter.
1004160	1005160	It's incredibly relatable.
1005240	1011240	I assume that's why so many people have followed you is to the relatability of what you're
1011240	1012240	putting down there.
1012240	1018020	Yes, actually, I have been told, but in our honesty, people, if you follow at Trisha
1018020	1023160	KS, please do let me know why you follow me because I don't know why I have no idea
1023160	1032120	why people follow me, but okay, so I would say it's like, okay, I treat Twitter as my,
1032360	1037880	should I say like my diary, like my confession, like my, like my everything, like where I
1037880	1042920	trash talk or if I have some unfunny funny jokes, maybe funny jokes for me.
1042920	1046040	And then I'm like, oh, actually, people are liking this.
1046040	1047920	It's like, I just post them out.
1047920	1052280	And also, my tweets are short because I don't like to read long things.
1052280	1059040	I'm not someone who likes to read long stuff, even like threads, unless it's like, it's
1059120	1061280	really something I have to learn.
1061280	1062280	I want to understand.
1062280	1066680	But otherwise, I'm not someone who likes to read a long sentence.
1066680	1071280	Like one sentence that is effective straight to the point touches your soul, you're related
1071280	1075400	to it, then that's, that's like, that's like good enough for me.
1075400	1081240	And so I always try to keep my tweets short because that's the kind of tweets I would
1081240	1082240	like to see.
1082240	1085000	I'm not judging anyone on anything.
1085000	1086160	You are your own person.
1086160	1087160	I'm my own person.
1087160	1088160	I like short things.
1088160	1091680	You might like long things, but then I do what works for me.
1091680	1094920	And if you like it, then thank you so much.
1094920	1097160	I, I don't try to be relatable.
1097160	1102520	I just, I post things that just randomly go through my mind or the thing I faced for the
1102520	1103880	day.
1103880	1110320	And so yeah, I, yeah, I guess that's like, that's it on that.
1110320	1114880	Well, you know, it's interesting because there is something to be said about finding your
1114880	1117440	style or knowing your style and being authentic.
1117440	1121060	It's a much easier to be yourself than to, you know, if you were going to approach Twitter
1121060	1124160	and say, well, it seems like all of tech Twitter is long post and thread.
1124160	1128440	So I need to find a way to do what I would normally do as long posts and threads.
1128440	1129760	It wouldn't sound like you.
1129760	1131720	It maybe wouldn't be interesting to follow.
1131720	1138760	So you know, as you sort of develop that style, like, have you adopted any of what we'll call
1138760	1139760	the Twitter meta?
1139760	1144680	Like, have you, have you become more aware of the, the times when posting gets more engagement
1144680	1147240	or, or is this truly sort of incidental?
1147240	1152120	Like, you're just posting what you're thinking when you're thinking of it and it's still
1152120	1153120	connecting.
1153120	1159280	Well, I would say I'm just, I'm just the person you see people as the person you see
1159280	1166400	on my timeline, I, I, I post what I like, I post what I think, but I will admit starting
1166400	1172760	my early days of content creation on tech, Twitter, it's, it's, it's really hard to like
1172800	1178280	immediately find a niche, something you, you would like to be known for.
1178280	1182960	And so I have dipped and doubled on some few things that creating threads.
1182960	1186720	Like I just said, I don't like threads and I created threads.
1186720	1193040	And I guess I wouldn't say I expressed myself authentically doing that.
1193040	1197880	And then also, if you are on Twitter, Rob, you, you always, you must have seen people
1197880	1204080	posting eight AI tools and, you know, yeah, you know,
1204080	1205000	right, exactly.
1205000	1213880	Yeah, the eight AI tools, he has how to find them a thread and all that stuff.
1213880	1215400	I've tried all of those.
1215400	1217160	They didn't work for me.
1217160	1220440	And then I was like, okay, everyone is doing it.
1220440	1222240	Every account is doing it.
1222240	1227240	Everyone is like, I don't know how do I set you apart from someone else?
1227240	1231640	Because it's like, I will follow five people and then post the same thing,
1231640	1233800	the same syntax, whatever.
1233800	1235640	I'm saying syntax on Twitter people.
1235640	1242520	I don't know why, but it's like, I had to think of like setting myself apart.
1242520	1245720	You know, like, what, what is it I would like to be known for?
1245720	1248360	I don't want to be like everyone else, you know?
1248360	1251920	And so it's like, okay, what do I like to do?
1251920	1253520	I like to do CSS.
1253520	1255120	I like to do CSS code.
1255120	1256600	I like to do CSS arts.
1257080	1258320	And then I started by that.
1258320	1260120	I started sharing my CSS arts.
1260120	1262960	I started to share my CSS project.
1262960	1265480	And then from project, it went to CSS puns.
1265480	1269320	And I was like, hmm, I'm a sucker for dead jokes.
1269320	1271680	Let me post those and people like them.
1271680	1276880	And then I was like, hmm, the more I learned JavaScript, I could be able to make a pun
1276880	1279840	out of JavaScript and make some unfunny jokes.
1279840	1281760	And then I posted those two.
1281760	1284600	And so over time, people liked it.
1284600	1289320	And then I have what, close to 40K followers on Twitter.
1289320	1293800	I don't know why people, but yes, it's, it's like that.
1293800	1295320	It took some time.
1295320	1301560	So just, just be yourself, be authentic self, set yourself apart, make people think
1301560	1302720	about you.
1302720	1306480	And when they think about you, they must associate something with you.
1306480	1311120	Like when they think of CSS, they're like, okay, I'm going to follow Tricia.
1311480	1314840	Sorry, I'm going to follow Tricia or web three.
1314840	1318160	I'm going to follow Francesco or Denny Thompson.
1318160	1322080	I'm going to follow for motivation, inspiration, that sort of thing.
1322440	1327560	And so your goal is to be identified by something and have that something
1327560	1330120	associated with your name on tech Twitter.
1330600	1331720	That's my advice.
1331720	1334480	I can give you on growing on tech to be yourself.
1334480	1338280	Share your niche and just, just do what you like.
1338280	1340120	And then people will like you for it.
1340280	1342040	You don't have to do a lot of things.
1342600	1345400	It just, it will grow on its own.
1345600	1346240	Be patient.
1347720	1348720	Patience is a big one.
1349240	1353560	But, you know, I like this idea too that, you know, when everybody is, if
1353560	1358920	everybody's doing a certain thing, then people feel compelled to do it and they
1358920	1361680	feel a little bit like you did at the beginning, which is to say, like people
1361680	1365160	without a community, they say, well, I like weird silly jokes.
1365160	1366760	And I like not taking things too seriously.
1366760	1369200	And I like talking about CSS, but everybody's talking about React.
1369200	1371120	So I guess I need to talk about React on Twitter.
1371480	1375600	And it's like, you know, I was a, a gamer many years ago, long before it was
1375600	1376880	quite as mainstream as it was now.
1376880	1379640	And I remember being in conversations with people and, you know, you're like, oh,
1379640	1381880	the weather, oh, sports, oh, business.
1381880	1383440	And you kind of just have in that conversation.
1383680	1386160	And then maybe it slips that one of you plays a video game.
1386160	1389000	And then the other person goes, wait, you play, you play video games.
1390280	1395160	And all of a sudden then this, all this animation and, you know, this, this nerd
1395160	1398760	found another nerd and they have a moment of community and bonding.
1399000	1401160	And a deeper conversation than they ever would have had.
1401560	1403040	And you can be that on Twitter, right?
1403040	1406280	Like you can be that person that is talking about the thing that maybe
1406280	1409320	nobody else is talking about, but people really want to, but think they're not
1409320	1409920	allowed to.
1410240	1413480	Uh, and you know, it's like you said, when clearly people were hungry for that
1413480	1418960	kind of, uh, you know, silliness as well as CSS talk, uh, in a world full of a
1418960	1420000	lot of JavaScript talks.
1420000	1422520	So, um, you know, happy that you found a niche.
1422680	1425920	Maybe not everybody will find quite as potent of a niche, but you'll certainly
1425920	1427720	enjoy your experience on Twitter a lot more.
1427720	1432200	You will find your tribe, even if your tribe isn't extremely large, uh, as long
1432200	1433080	as you're being yourself.
1433120	1434800	So yeah, absolutely.
1436760	1437080	Okay.
1437080	1441960	So then you sort of progress from, from, uh, well, I mean, you're still on Twitter,
1441960	1445200	but we've progressed the story from, from Twitter to getting a job.
1445200	1449480	And what's fascinating about your job journey is that you pretty quickly went,
1449560	1454400	um, from self taught developer to developer relations engineer or developer
1454400	1459760	advocate and, um, you know, this is certainly a career that has over gone a
1459760	1463880	lot of changes, certainly during the pandemic, but, but over the last many
1463880	1468880	years as the, as it's matured, um, and, you know, I don't know that there's been a
1468880	1472760	ton of people talking about starting with developer relations or developer
1472760	1477520	advocacy as opposed to like maybe, um, switching over to it after a little bit
1477520	1478480	of time of being a developer.
1478480	1482480	So can you kind of explain, um, how you, I mean, you talked a little bit about how
1482480	1486920	you got the job, but kind of how you got into this, uh, this career and how you
1486920	1491880	sort of, uh, dealt with it coming from maybe not, you know, a 10 year career
1491880	1495120	being a developer already and kind of what challenges and opportunities that,
1495160	1496000	that provided for you.
1498200	1498720	Okay.
1498720	1507760	So how I, I would say how I discovered developer advocacy was because of
1507840	1511520	Pratham does, there's a user by the name of Pratham.
1511520	1518560	She's an Indian, uh, developer advocate at N host, which is an open source company.
1518560	1525560	I forgot for what, but she is the sole responsible person that I am in developer
1525560	1526160	advocacy.
1526160	1528440	Well, I was interested in it.
1528440	1530000	I am still in interested in it.
1530440	1537000	Um, and so I discovered that last year, like January, February,
1537000	1546400	summer day, and I, what, what really brought me into liking Devra was how it was
1546400	1548920	described the role of the job.
1549440	1553760	So the role of the job, basically, it involves, I think, four pillars.
1553760	1556680	If I'm not mistaken, one is education.
1556680	1562600	So creating content for developers, making sure that they are learning, uh, about the
1562600	1564720	product they, they are representing.
1564720	1569440	And so, uh, the education you create is to help developers be successful with the
1569440	1570520	product they're using.
1570760	1576120	And then the second pillar is marketing, bringing awareness, going to tech conferences,
1576120	1578440	speaking about the product you're representing.
1578440	1587160	The third thing is, um, if I'm not mistaken, it's community, community management.
1587520	1592360	So you're going to be engaging a lot with community management, uh, community
1592360	1595600	members and helping them out.
1595600	1600360	And, you know, just basically forming relationships with your community.
1600360	1602720	And then the fourth one is coding.
1603040	1608600	So you must have some technical skill to be able to relate with the community you
1608600	1612040	are representing for to the company.
1612560	1615720	And so I was like, that's a nice job.
1615720	1620360	That is what I am doing as a, as a tech tweeter person.
1620520	1621640	I'm not an influencer.
1621640	1623840	I refuse to be known as that.
1625800	1632760	That is what I'm doing here on Twitter.
1633760	1641360	So I, what I, what led me into believing that I can also be a developer advocate was
1641360	1643560	that I'm so, I have a blog.
1644200	1645640	I love writing things down.
1645640	1650520	I, I would say I communicate so much better when I write things down.
1650520	1653120	It's an actual verbal communication.
1653120	1655520	And so I love creating content.
1655920	1659760	I love, uh, showing people how they can use something.
1659760	1663520	I remember there was a time where Tylen CSS was something new to me.
1663840	1665240	And I started using it.
1665240	1670400	And then I went all in to convince people that, hey, leave bootstrap behind.
1670440	1672080	Bootstrap is not for you.
1672080	1673400	Go to Tylen CSS.
1673680	1675720	I will convince you, I will show you.
1676000	1677080	And that's what I did.
1677080	1681680	I would make demos and show people that this is how you build a button in less
1681680	1685280	than five minutes, of course, if my typing speed suffices.
1685600	1688480	But, you know, I, I used to do those things.
1688480	1690240	I used to like advocate.
1690240	1695440	I used to, I, I, I like communicating with people, the community and all that stuff.
1695440	1697920	I know I said I have social anxiety.
1697920	1703480	I don't like to talk to people, but I do enjoy to talk to somebody to help them
1703480	1704520	achieve something.
1704520	1706640	And so I was enjoying that.
1706640	1707920	And I was like coding.
1707920	1708800	I, I code.
1708800	1709760	I love to code.
1709760	1711520	I would say it's fun.
1711520	1713960	It's, it's, it's a combination of things that I like.
1713960	1715760	And I want to experience this field.
1715760	1717840	I want to work as a developer advocate.
1718440	1719600	I got the job.
1719600	1720840	I worked at Strapi.
1720840	1721800	It was amazing.
1721800	1724400	It was everything I imagined and even more.
1724920	1730240	And, and so, yeah, man, I, I don't know if I should go on from this point.
1730240	1735040	But the point is developer advocacy is an amazing role.
1735040	1740080	It's, it's just like you work with people, you meet amazing people.
1740080	1745720	And you, you get to do the things you like as a job and you get paid for it.
1745720	1750040	I mean, who gets paid to write blogs for fun?
1750320	1752400	I mean, I find it writing fun.
1752400	1756040	And, and you know, it's, it's like, it's a dream position.
1756280	1761560	And also you travel, but I didn't get the chance to, but still you travel because
1761560	1762320	of your job.
1762760	1764960	And so it has a lot of con.
1765200	1766920	No, wait, is it cons or pros?
1766920	1767720	Which one is good?
1767960	1769040	Which one is the pros?
1769560	1770360	OK, it's the pros.
1771320	1774200	Oh, my God, the pros are good.
1775120	1775920	That's what I mean.
1775920	1777040	The pros are good.
1777200	1778040	That's what I meant.
1778040	1784040	So yeah, it's interesting because, you know, I think I think people have gotten
1784040	1787200	better in the community of understanding this role a little bit more.
1787200	1792280	But I think there are still some, maybe perceptions or misperceptions exist.
1792800	1798520	Um, one of them is that, oh, I want to be in DevRel because I would just get
1798520	1803120	to code demos all day and then travel to conferences and it would be the coolest
1803120	1803560	job.
1803800	1807280	I hear a lot of people talking about it the same way they talk about like being
1807480	1809720	like a Twitch streamer or like a YouTuber.
1809720	1812720	They're like, oh, I get to play video games all day for a living.
1812720	1814120	What an amazing life.
1814480	1819480	And I don't think they fully understand the hard bits behind it, the metrics, the
1819480	1821960	parts that are not as glamorous, but are difficult.
1822280	1825800	Um, and other people worry that, you know, if I go to DevRel, maybe all I'll be
1825800	1828760	doing is blogs or all I'll be doing is talking to people.
1828760	1830640	I lose all my technical acumen.
1830640	1831920	I won't grow anymore.
1832160	1836240	So I wonder if you could speak to both of those perceptions, both that DevRel is
1836240	1842200	this glamorous, enjoyable, never ending fun of all the best parts of development
1842200	1845600	and none of the hard parts like deadlines and clients.
1846080	1850240	And the other side of people that feel like it's non-technical and maybe they
1850240	1854600	would, they would not be as much of a developer or, or struggle in their growth
1854600	1855360	if they were DevRel.
1858080	1858600	Okay.
1858600	1865480	So I would say developer relations is, like you said, there are good parts and
1865480	1867080	then there are bad parts to it.
1867600	1873400	But for me personally speaking, oh no, personally speaking for myself, I would
1873400	1878480	say the bad part is there's a lot of things going on.
1878480	1883640	Like as much as the schedule, like you don't know how your day is going to go,
1883880	1884960	which is awesome.
1885040	1886720	I, I like that about it.
1887240	1890760	But at the same time, it's like, you don't know how your day is going to go.
1891080	1892840	And you have so much to learn.
1892840	1894680	There's a lot of things to learn.
1895200	1900640	And I remember there was, I, we were working on an initiative at Strapi.
1900640	1905160	And one of the initiatives was to form a partnership with Versell.
1905520	1908800	And it's not exactly marketing.
1908800	1914400	It's not exactly, you know, community and, and, um, you know, education.
1914400	1915680	It's more like sales.
1916000	1921360	So you have to like get into other departments and to work with other teams.
1921360	1926400	You have to be someone who collaborates openly with other teams within the company
1926640	1931280	to make sure that you, you know, you, you make things work.
1931280	1935520	So sales, I don't know anything about salespeople.
1935880	1940680	I was like, how am I going to do this for Sal me?
1941240	1945680	But anyway, it's, it's like there's a lot to learn and you also have to be
1945680	1947400	comfortable with being flexible.
1947760	1951920	So like I said, I don't know anything about sales, but you have to be comfortable
1951920	1957520	about not knowing what sales is and being able to take the role and being like, okay,
1957520	1958640	let's break it down.
1958640	1960640	What's the first step to achieving this goal?
1960640	1961760	What do we have to do?
1961760	1962800	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1963360	1965360	So I'd say those are difficult.
1965360	1971440	And also when it comes to like community, community management is not as easy as it looks.
1971440	1975840	Just having a lot of people in your community, the numbers don't matter.
1975840	1980640	It, what matters is how are you going to make the community grow?
1980720	1985040	How are you going to help everyone to grow while using your product?
1985040	1988560	Because, you know, like with, with community, they are people too.
1988560	1989600	We are people too.
1989600	1996480	People get frustrated and it just so happens that it's, it's so hard to, to, to, to, to manage
1996480	1999440	a community because you always have to think of something else.
1999440	2000720	How do I make it better?
2000720	2002240	How do I introduce new things?
2002240	2003680	Will they like, will they not?
2004720	2007840	How do we help everyone with questions about Strapi?
2007840	2010320	Because we, we can't, we can't do that too.
2010320	2011360	We, we are people.
2011360	2016560	We, we, yeah, it's just, those are the few things I can, oh yes.
2016560	2022880	And when it comes to video people, even, even if you are an expert on creating videos,
2022880	2029840	you will spend, I don't know, there was a time I had to record a simple, simple video on how
2029840	2032240	you can upgrade just Strapi application.
2032800	2039120	Believe you me, I sat here at 9am and finally got off my chair, I think at 3pm.
2039680	2042000	It was a less than three minute video.
2043280	2047200	And, and I had to like do a lot of pre-shoots and all that stuff.
2047200	2051440	Like it's, it's, it's, it's like not as simple as it seems.
2051440	2056800	And also, even after you shoot, you have to get feedback and then do it again.
2056800	2062160	So it's like, yeah man, this, this, this, this challenges everywhere.
2062160	2067040	Even with blog writing, the blogs you write, they have to accommodate the community.
2067040	2069200	It's not about what you like to write about.
2069200	2071360	It's about what the community needs.
2071360	2076000	And so you're going to have to write about something you have no clue about.
2076000	2078720	And so that's, that's on that.
2079440	2082080	It's, that's my views on that.
2082080	2084080	Yeah, it's, it's, it's so fascinating.
2084080	2088720	I, I love this idea because it's so true that there is nothing more difficult
2088720	2090240	than looking effortless.
2090240	2092800	Like, uh, people maybe learned this.
2092800	2095120	I think we still get fooled by it often on like Instagram.
2095120	2097920	People are like, wow, this person is so glamorous.
2097920	2100000	They take such amazing photos.
2100000	2103360	How could that be your first, your, the first selfie you took out of bed?
2103360	2109520	It's like, it's, it's not got up, put on makeup, set everything up right,
2109520	2113200	put up lights, took a thousand photos and that was the best one.
2113280	2115520	Like, you know, but it looks effortless.
2115520	2119440	And I think good developer relations, good videos and things like that are like that,
2119440	2124800	right? It's born of a lot of, of iteration, of a lot of retries and a lot of reshoots
2125440	2131120	to produce something that feels, uh, solid, that feels good, that feels effortless
2131120	2132160	when somebody watches it.
2132160	2136160	Doesn't mean that it's perfect, um, but it, but it, but it, it sort of melds.
2136160	2137760	And I mean, we have that in development too.
2137760	2141840	I, I like to tell people that like when you get a good designer that puts a good design
2141840	2143760	together for you, it's like a website.
2143760	2147360	It's like you can't tell what the HTML elements are that built it.
2147360	2149600	It just turns into a painting.
2149600	2155440	And I said, it doesn't take a lot sometimes, a little bit of spacing mess up, a little bit
2155440	2160160	of style, oddness and the whole cohesiveness of the design fractures.
2160160	2162480	And you go, that's clearly a div.
2162480	2163440	That's clearly an input.
2163440	2164480	That's clearly a button.
2164480	2164960	That's clear.
2164960	2167200	And it just turns into all the constituent elements.
2167200	2168320	So there's just something about that.
2168480	2173840	Like when, when something finally congeals at the end, it looks well polished.
2173840	2179520	Um, and, uh, it doesn't take a lot of deviance from that for people to see
2179520	2182880	behind the scenes of it a little bit, which is, I think is super interesting.
2183440	2185360	I guess that sounds like that should be intimidating.
2185360	2190080	I actually get inspired by it because I think it's really cool to find that point
2190080	2191760	when everything kind of blends together.
2193280	2197600	I think so too, because from challenges, that's where you learn the most,
2197600	2203360	you know, it's, it's like, as much as I was intimidated by this whole partnership with
2203360	2206880	Vercel, I got to learn a lot from it.
2206880	2211600	Like how you, um, you started actually forming partnership.
2211600	2212480	What is the point?
2212480	2215200	What are we trying to do and create sales pipeline?
2215200	2216240	All that stuff.
2216240	2217520	Community management.
2217520	2223520	It gives you that mindset that, you know what, community is more than just the number.
2223600	2231840	It's more about how you help the people succeed, you know, what it's, it's more than that.
2231840	2233360	That's, that's what I learned.
2233360	2239360	And with blogging as well, I mean, as much as I was a blog myself, a blogger myself,
2239360	2244400	as a hobby, I learned that there's a lot of work that goes into blogging
2244400	2249280	and how you can make a blog stand out, how you can communicate with your target audience,
2249280	2251280	how to capture people's attention.
2251360	2255920	That kind of stuff, I learned that in my role.
2255920	2264480	And so being flexible too, it does help to, to, to expect the unexpected and learning how to
2264480	2268160	adapt to those circumstances is really important.
2268160	2275520	And I would say those are one of the skills I also gained and community and communication
2275520	2278480	with different departments within the team.
2279200	2286400	And so it might seem intimidating, but it is for a good cause because it does open your mind
2286400	2289680	to a lot of things, things that you have never thought about.
2289680	2294080	And when you face something like that, again, then you know what to do.
2294080	2297600	And if you face another problem, then it's, it's a learning opportunity.
2297600	2301360	So I take these challenges as a learning opportunity.
2302320	2305040	And, you know, I like how this connects to the Twitter piece.
2305040	2308240	And I think it's maybe part of the reason why you enjoy it is I think one of the
2308240	2312160	recipes for success in developer relations and advocacy is, is authenticity.
2312960	2319040	Developers are better than average at sniffing out inauthentic contributors
2319040	2321840	or brands hiding behind developer relations.
2321840	2326720	They know when they're being sold to, but they love when they're being related to
2326720	2328400	and when they're really being engaged.
2328400	2332800	And so I think that can sometimes be challenging for people at the beginning,
2332800	2336880	because if you don't feel strong in your own brand or in the brand of the company,
2337520	2339520	in your approach, that can be tough.
2339520	2342400	And it can be tough sometimes to sustain.
2342400	2345440	I tell people like, you can make a discord all you want,
2345440	2347520	and you can get a couple people to join.
2347520	2350560	But can you get the conversation to keep going so that it's there in a month?
2350560	2354160	So that it's there in a year, you know, you can get somebody to read a blog.
2354160	2358480	But can you create a platform where people will want to keep coming back to read your blogs?
2358480	2359920	That is hard.
2359920	2361200	There's not a shortcut for it.
2361200	2362640	There's no magic recipe for it.
2362640	2367040	But it is a lot harder, or not harder, again, not to be intimidating.
2367040	2370160	It's a lot more of a challenge than people might give it credit for.
2371600	2375440	It's even a slightly different skill set than just producing an individual piece of content,
2375440	2380480	is to slot that into where is my community that's sort of starting to grow,
2380480	2383120	and it's starting to smoke and turn into a small flame,
2383120	2387200	and how do I keep feeding them with more outlets, more videos, more content,
2387200	2388640	so that it actually catches.
2388720	2392080	And then to see a community begin to self-sustain,
2393040	2398240	I mean, that has to be such a feeling of pride and happiness in that job.
2398240	2400320	I don't know if you've got to experience that as well.
2402480	2405280	Well, I do experience that.
2405280	2410960	It's like, I don't know, we must remember that behind these communities,
2410960	2412720	it's real people.
2412720	2414240	Those are real people.
2414240	2415840	The same with Tech Twitter.
2415840	2417680	Those accounts, the actual people.
2417760	2418880	I'm an actual person.
2418880	2420320	I'm not an AI robot.
2420880	2425360	And so people cannot be programmed to come back for more.
2425360	2426800	They're not callback functions.
2427600	2428560	Okay, that was lousy.
2428560	2429920	I should have said that.
2429920	2438640	But it's really hard to get someone to come back,
2438640	2442000	to actually like your things, and come back for more.
2442000	2447280	And so it's a skill that I think it's so hard to craft,
2447280	2451520	and to what is the word, to master.
2451520	2456320	And so it's like you find what people are looking for,
2456320	2458560	and you pay attention to what people need.
2459200	2462880	And once you give people what they want,
2462880	2464800	and they see that you're listening to them,
2464800	2466960	they see that you hear the cries they're paying,
2467600	2472720	then I guess that will also help with them being able to trust
2472720	2474160	that you are doing this for them.
2474160	2476720	And then they can come back for more.
2476720	2480560	And if someone else they know are facing similar problems,
2480560	2482240	they know which community,
2482240	2485600	which company they can direct those people to.
2485600	2488720	And that also creates marketing.
2488720	2493520	You know, word of mouth is the most powerful marketing tool out there.
2493520	2499600	And so you do want to make sure that the people you are taking care of,
2499600	2503280	they feel safe, they feel appreciated.
2503280	2506560	And once they feel the trust, the credibility,
2506560	2510160	then they have no doubt but to come back.
2510160	2512880	And yeah, like I said, it's not easy.
2512880	2514560	I'm not mastering it.
2514560	2516000	It's something I'm learning to.
2516720	2519360	And yeah, that's the job.
2519360	2520640	It's all about learning.
2520640	2522640	It's all about facing challenges.
2522640	2527200	And yeah, crying sometimes, but tears of joy.
2529040	2530480	And that's where the community helps.
2530480	2534320	You know, what I love about some of the names in the community
2534320	2539920	that you've talked about is that a lot of them are relatively junior in their careers.
2539920	2544720	And I love that learning in public became a trend.
2544720	2546720	And supporting each other, learning in public,
2546720	2549680	became one of the foundational elements of Tech Twitter.
2549680	2552560	Again, I know there's a lot of noise out there and a lot of nastiness at times.
2552560	2556640	But that core of it, I think, is exciting.
2556640	2559120	Because it does mean that when things are hard,
2559120	2560880	you at least have some people you can go to and say,
2560880	2561920	wow, this is really hard.
2561920	2563440	And people can say, I agree.
2563440	2566000	It is actually sometimes really hard.
2566720	2570480	And I like that word that we can at times be a humble community
2570480	2575120	and not be afraid to admit that sometimes this is overwhelming for all of us.
2575120	2578400	And so that if you're feeling that way as somebody who's either just starting out
2578400	2582320	on their self-taught journey or is lost looking for a job right now,
2583600	2587360	there are a lot of people like you out there that you can connect with
2588080	2589920	on Twitter or other spaces as well.
2589920	2592800	Discord's been a great place these days to find those people as well.
2594800	2600000	Yes, but I must admit, I am actually not as active on Discord.
2600000	2604800	Like, it's like, Twitter's my cave, like my bad cave.
2604800	2607280	I'm always on Twitter all the time.
2607280	2608640	Discord for some reason.
2608640	2613440	I don't know what, but it's not doing it for me for some reason.
2614080	2615280	But I do try.
2615280	2619040	I would say there are a lot of great communities that I've joined on Discord.
2619680	2623200	For example, the 4C community, which is ran by Francesco.
2623600	2629040	It also does have a lot of newbies, a lot of people who are interested in tech.
2629040	2634720	And he also helps them out with resources for learning and for web-free resources.
2634720	2642000	So that's Francesco and another community is, I think coding newbies does have one too.
2642000	2646320	On Discord, if I'm not mistaken, the name itself, it says it all,
2646320	2647200	coding newbies.
2647200	2650400	So that's a great place to also connect with people.
2650400	2655920	It might not be people who are like new in tech, but you will find that
2655920	2660880	someone is learning the exact same thing as you and the conversation can skyrocket
2660880	2665840	into something else, a great connection, friendship, whatever you would like to name it.
2665840	2668640	And so Discord does have great communities.
2668640	2670320	Oh, and Eddie Hub, and Eddie Hub.
2670320	2671440	How can I forget, Eddie Hub?
2672720	2673600	Yes, Eddie.
2674160	2678480	And yeah, those are a few communities I can name the great communities.
2679200	2681600	And yeah, people use Discord.
2681600	2682800	Don't be like me.
2682800	2684080	You'll find a lot of value.
2685840	2686320	You'll find.
2687840	2689760	Yeah, use Discord.
2690640	2691600	It's taste their own.
2691600	2692960	I mean, I think that's the lesson, right?
2693760	2697040	Just finding your niche to contribute to any particular platform is find the platform that
2697040	2697920	works best for you.
2697920	2701600	I know people who never resonated with any platform they sell, they started contributing
2701600	2702480	on LinkedIn.
2702480	2704080	And that's where they found their tribe.
2704080	2706000	And that's where they really resonated with people.
2706000	2711440	And it's like, yeah, let's take advantage of the existence of so many social networks and
2711440	2714240	not feel compelled to necessarily engage with all of them.
2714240	2717680	But to find the tribe again, that works best for us.
2718640	2719840	I agree.
2719840	2720320	I agree.
2720320	2721200	Thank you so much.
2721760	2726560	I'm just like, it doesn't help to be everywhere at once.
2726560	2729760	So just stick with one place that you like.
2729760	2731680	I grew on Twitter.
2731680	2735200	I can't imagine starting my growth on LinkedIn.
2735200	2738000	It's like, well, people are serious.
2739120	2740720	It's all seriousness.
2740720	2745760	So it's like, yeah, stick to one platform, grow, make friends there.
2745760	2748480	And you don't have to worry about anything else.
2748480	2751760	I guess, you know, just find what works for you.
2751760	2752560	Don't be pressured.
2753840	2755280	Now, we're wrapping things up here.
2755280	2757520	But at the end, we like to ask a little bit of a fun question.
2757520	2761040	And I happen to see, well, looking into your profile that you are a big
2761600	2762960	Marvel cinematic universe fan.
2762960	2763520	Oh, yes.
2763520	2767600	So at the time that this will come out, it'll be pretty close to when the movie comes out.
2767600	2770720	But I'm curious, how excited are you for Ant-Man and the Wals?
2770720	2772800	Are you going to be there day one?
2773440	2774560	Are you super excited?
2776560	2778080	Let me tell you something.
2778080	2782240	I bought the ticket two weeks ago.
2782240	2784000	That's how prepared I am.
2784000	2789120	I was like, on Friday, 2pm, because that's the time it's going to play for us.
2789120	2792160	2pm afternoon, Ant-Man is playing.
2792160	2794480	And to be honest, I'm actually afraid.
2800720	2803120	Ant-Man is my favorite.
2803680	2805760	It's my favorite MCU character.
2805760	2809040	You will even see on my bio, I have a spider.
2809040	2810880	I mean, not a spider, an ant.
2810880	2815120	That ant, a lot of people don't figure it out that, oh, that ant is for Ant-Man.
2815120	2816480	That emojis for Ant-Man.
2816480	2822240	So if Ant-Man dies, if Paul Rudd dies, oh, no, people, I don't think I'll recover.
2822240	2826880	So hopefully it might be, it might be if you're listening to this podcast
2826880	2828320	that you have now seen the movie.
2828880	2831360	And so if the unfortunate has happened,
2831360	2834480	please reach out to Tricia and make sure that she's doing well in her time of mourning.
2834480	2838000	But I didn't know, I thought that was just because of the movie coming out.
2838000	2839760	I didn't realize that was more of a global thing.
2839760	2842480	Well, I wish you luck then watching the movie.
2842480	2845600	So I will also be there the first weekend,
2845600	2850480	because I cannot avoid spoilers for very long, you know, there's the downside of social media.
2850480	2852640	So I need to see things on opening night or else.
2852640	2855840	The spoilers, the spoilers are so bad.
2855840	2860560	I tell you, the people who spoil Marvel movies are not Marvel fans.
2860560	2866560	I said it because if you are a true Marvel fan, you would never spoil that for another fellow person.
2866560	2873040	So if you are DC, please stop, stop posting, please.
2874880	2876240	All right, well, we'll leave it there.
2876240	2878560	We hope that it, we hope that it's enjoyable.
2878560	2879920	I certainly hope that it's enjoyable as well.
2879920	2881120	I hope so.
2881120	2884880	I hope so, dude, like you have no idea how stressed I am.
2884880	2888080	I'm like, do I, do I have to buy it another time?
2888080	2890160	Because like, I'm so stressed out.
2890160	2893600	But anyway, I just hope Paul Rudd doesn't die or anyone doesn't die.
2894240	2899360	Like, but knowing Marvel in every third movie, someone dies.
2899360	2901680	So I have to be emotionally prepared.
2904320	2904800	All right.
2905600	2907040	Well, that's going to be it for us today.
